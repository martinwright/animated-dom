                <p>When identifying and mitigating risks, the project manager needs to, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>identify potential hazards and risks during the planning stage
                    </li>

                    <li>create a risk log or register – and use it to mitigate risk
                    </li>

                    <li>maintain awareness of potential risks
                    </li>

                    <li>consult stakeholders to agree approaches to risk management
                    </li>

                    <li>use leadership skills to manage risks that materialise
                    </li>

                    <li>amend plans when risks have an impact on the critical path or other timelines.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The following table shows some suggestions about how the risks mentioned above could be identified
                    and mitigated:</p>
