                <p>The project manager needs to evaluate a project and look at all of the data that has been collected,
                    so that the team can, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>compare the outcomes with the original objectives</strong><br>to see if the project has
                        achieved its intended aims and the correct quality standards
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>understand how the project has achieved its purpose</strong><br>or why it has failed
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>identify how the project used human resources</strong><br>eg to analyse the skills used
                        and identify career development opportunities
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>identify how efficiently the project used physical resources</strong><br>eg comparing
                        budget forecasts with actual costs; reviewing the levels of waste
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>identify problems and potential improvements</strong>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>advise stakeholders and decision-makers</strong><br>about how to repeat, develop or
                        improve actions and plans for future projects
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>identify needs for further project work</strong><br>eg to set up a new project to solve
                        major issues that were discovered when working on the first project.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>When evaluating a project, the data needs to be reliable and relevant to be of use. We need to
                    consider what we want to know, and what we want to measure, to be able to identify what data we need
                    and how we will collect it.</p>

                <p>Organisations will have their own ways of evaluating a project, which could include, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>comparing estimated costs with actual costs</strong><br>to evaluate the budget
                        allocations and identify the causes of variance
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>collecting and reviewing feedback from customers and other users of the services and
                        products covered in the project</strong><br>eg independent surveys, feedback forms, forum
                        comments, focus groups or satisfaction surveys
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>analysing operational data</strong><br>eg looking at patient records in a hospital to
                        evaluate changes in services
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>reviewing progress reports</strong><br>eg final ‘wash-up’ reports from staff and other
                        stakeholders about their experiences and recommendations
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>analysing sales patterns</strong><br>eg to see when tickets were purchased and by whom;
                        to see if business changes have affected sales as expected
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>analysing changes in activity and comments on websites and social media</strong><br>eg
                        to illustrate a change towards Internet shopping following a project on online sales.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The methods selected will depend upon who needs and wants to see the evaluation of project
                    performance. The media, for example, might only be interested in the initial financial impact of
                    changes made by the project, whereas the organisation’s HR department will be more interested in
                    evaluating the impact on staff skills, experience, training and career development. Reviews of
                    project performance need to be presented in ways that satisfy the needs of stakeholders.</p>

                <p>In general, the project team’s review needs to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>show the successes of the project
                    </li>

                    <li>praise everyone who contributed to the success
                    </li>

                    <li>identify areas of weakness and lessons that can be learnt for future projects
                    </li>

                    <li>illustrate the project team’s value to support bids for future projects.
                    </li>

                </ul>
