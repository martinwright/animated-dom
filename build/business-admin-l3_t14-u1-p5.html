                     data-animate="6"/>

                <p>The Equality Act 2010 is the current legislation that deals with equality and discrimination in the
                    UK. The Act gives individuals rights as it is unlawful to discriminate against anyone because of a
                    <strong>protected characteristic</strong>:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>age </strong>– all people over 18 are protected at work or in work training
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>disability or impairment </strong>– organisations must make ‘reasonable adjustments’ to
                        accommodate staff, customers and visitors with disabilities
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>gender </strong>– equal pay, training and opportunity for males and females
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>gender reassignment </strong>– people changing from male to female, or female to male
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>marriage or civil partnership </strong>– preventing discrimination on the grounds of
                        being married or in a civil partnership, at work or in work training
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>pregnancy or maternity (including breastfeeding) </strong>– only reasons of safety are
                        not covered – eg equality may not be possible for pregnant women in some circumstances if the
                        activity could harm them or the baby
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>race </strong>– wherever they were born, their parents’ and their own race, colour,
                        ethnicity are protected
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>religion or beliefs </strong>– any religion, lack of religion or personal belief is
                        protected
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>sexual orientation </strong>– heterosexual, gay, lesbian and bisexual people are
                        covered.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>If there are special operational reasons, such as carers in a nursing home needing to be able to lift
                    residents, there are exceptions to the rule, but the employer must take great care to be as fair as
                    possible.</p>

                <p>Individuals are protected from discrimination in these situations:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>in the workplace </strong>– eg during recruitment and employment
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>in education </strong>– eg schools, colleges, training companies
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>as consumers </strong>– eg in shops, on the Internet, in cafés and restaurants, when buying
                        or renting property
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>when using public services </strong>– eg healthcare, libraries, transport, councils,
                        civil service
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>in clubs with more than 25 members </strong>– although the law does not stop clubs for
                        people who share a protected characteristic – eg men-only or women-only clubs, or social clubs
                        for Turkish people.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Individuals are also protected from discrimination if:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>they are associated with someone who has a protected characteristic </strong>– eg a
                        family member or friend
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>they have complained about discrimination or supported someone else’s claim</strong>.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>If people have a problem with discrimination at work that cannot be sorted with the employer, they
                    have the right to take action at an employment tribunal. The judge has the authority to award
                    compensation, to stop the employer discriminating or allow a dismissed person to come back to work.
                    The judge can also make recommendations that affect other employees, as well as the individual.</p>

                <p>There are many things that organisations need to observe. For example, employers have a
                    responsibility to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>avoid discriminating against employees, trainees and job applicants on the grounds of any of the
                        protected characteristics
                    </li>

                    <li>make ‘reasonable adjustments’ to accommodate staff, job applicants, trainees, customers and
                        visitors with disabilities or impairments
                    </li>

                    <li>make sure that discrimination is not tolerated, and take steps to deal with bullying,
                        harassment, victimisation or other forms of discrimination in the workplace
                    </li>

                    <li>give men and women equal pay and treatment in the terms and conditions of their employment
                        contract if they are employed to do work that is the same, broadly similar or of equal value in
                        terms of effort, skill or decision making
                    </li>

                    <li>train and monitor their workforce, and put in place policies and procedures for dealing with
                        problems and complaints
                    </li>

                    <li>make sure that all employees, customers, job applicants and visitors know where to find
                        information about their equality policies and procedures
                    </li>

                    <li>avoid asking job candidates about their health, age, absences due to pregnancy-related illnesses
                        etc during the application and interview processes – health questions can only be asked after a
                        job offer has been made.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Employees have a responsibility</strong> to make sure that they do not breach their
                    employer’s equality and diversity policies, codes of conduct or guidelines. The law requires each
                    individual to take responsibility and avoid discrimination, and the employer needs to give clear
                    guidelines in contracts of employment, equality and diversity policies, training sessions and so on.
                </p>

                <p>If an individual fails to follow the guidelines, the organisation can implement disciplinary action
                    or claim breach of contract (the employment contract).</p>

                <p>In terms of disciplinary procedures, managers could be involved with HR procedures and legislation
                    if, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>the employer discriminates and is taken to an employment tribunal
                    </li>

                    <li>a team member discriminates against someone illegally and has to be taken through the
                        disciplinary process.
                    </li>
                </ul>
