                <p>Subject specialists can be called in from time to time when the project manager needs specific
                    skills, usually during the planning and delivery stages. Specialist could be called in to deal with,
                    for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>health and safety assessments – eg in unusual work areas or environments
                    </li>

                    <li>firework displays for an event
                    </li>

                    <li>designers for stationery, posters and other marketing materials
                    </li>

                    <li>branding – eg for sponsorship coverage
                    </li>

                    <li>specialist equipment that is not normally used or owned by the organisation – eg staging,
                        marquees, lighting or sound systems
                    </li>

                    <li>accounts and audits.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Subject specialists might:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>work for other departments within the organisation – and be asked to assist with specific parts
                        of the project only
                    </li>

                    <li>work as freelancers – and be engaged for particular roles on a consultancy basis
                    </li>

                    <li>be part of specialist organisations – working as part of an independent external team that is
                        tasked to do specific activities
                    </li>

                    <li>be a full team member for the duration of the project.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Subject specialists are often separate from the main team, so the lines of communication and
                    responsibility need to be clearly defined. They are likely to be answerable to the project manager,
                    who acts as a line manager, and have access to more senior decision-makers when required.</p>
