                <h4 data-animate="2">1 Introduction</h4>

                <p>As we can see in a hospital, for example, difficult and complicated tasks are performed by several
                    different teams working together. The staff are interdependent and no team could run the hospital on
                    its own for long. For example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>the surgeons need the operating theatres to be fully cleaned and maintained by the facilities
                        management team
                    </li>

                    <li>the surgeons also need a fully qualified team of nurses, doctors and technicians to work with
                        them
                    </li>

                    <li>high-quality, sterile equipment used in theatre needs to be ordered, stored and managed by a
                        procurement team
                    </li>

                    <li>patients need to be prepared, processed and cared for by ward and outpatient clinic staff</li>

                    <li>some emergency patients need to be brought in by the ambulance service and may have been treated
                        by a paramedic at the scene
                    </li>

                    <li>staff on the occupational health team may help to rehabilitate the patient after surgery</li>

                    <li>social workers may be involved with getting support and care for the patient once they have been
                        discharged.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>When teams work together, sophisticated and complex tasks can be co-ordinated and performed to
                    provide an effective service. The organisational skills and input are considerable, but they are
                    necessary if complicated, cross-functional activities are to take place and be successful.</p>
