                <p>The manager needs to make sure that the members of the different teams get the credit when things go
                    well, and feel empowered to make decisions that are within the limits of their authority. This
                    encourages people to take pride in their work and be accountable for their actions. By taking
                    ownership, team members will be more proactive when problems arise and should enjoy better job
                    satisfaction when things go well.</p>

                <p>When there are problems, support needs to be given early to keep teams on track with achieving their
                    objectives – eg reviewing all relevant processes; allocating more resources; retraining or arranging
                    help from more experienced colleagues; letting team members go back to their original team.</p>

                <p>If team members know that they will be supported if there are problems, they are more likely to
                    commit to the common sense of purpose and organisational objectives. They will see that issues are
                    considered in detail for each team, and that they will not be left alone to struggle.</p>
