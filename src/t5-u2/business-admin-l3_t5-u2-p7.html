                <p>Challenges of cross-team working include, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>conflict</strong><br>e.g. unease between individuals or teams when they cannot agree
                        about objectives or standards; when one teamâ€™s problems have a knock-on effect on the other team
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>conflicts of interest</strong><br>e.g. when teams have incompatible goals or standards;
                        when one team focuses on quality and takes its time, while another focuses on fast production
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>practical difficulties</strong><br>e.g. when working together becomes difficult or
                        impossible due to management, logistical or time-management issues
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>lack of shared understanding</strong><br>e.g. due to lack of preparation, information or
                        briefing time
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>stress and anxiety</strong><br>e.g. when working on another team is in addition to
                        normal duties and becomes too much to cope with; when team members think that arrangements are
                        unnecessary or unreasonable; when tasks are allocated unfairly.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>When planning and managing cross-team working, managers need to think very carefully about the
                    different aspects of each situation or project, making sure that individuals are not stretched too
                    far in the quest for achieving organisational objectives. They need to employ excellent
                    organisational skills and be able to stand back to gain an overview of the whole situation.</p>
