                    <p>Team dynamics are the behavioural relationships between members of a group that are assigned
                        connected tasks within a company. Dynamics are affected by roles and responsibilities and have a
                        direct result on productivity.</p>

                    <p>It is important to build and maintain good working relationships, as this can impact on the work
                        that
                        is produced.</p>

                <p>Productive working relationships:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>help achieve targets and meet deadlines
                    </li>

                    <li>increase motivation
                    </li>

                    <li>increase efficiency, by sharing workloads

                <p>Poor working relationships are not effective for any organisation. The team will not feel productive
                    or motivated if its members:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>work in or create a culture of blame or criticism
                    </li>

                    <li>are self-opinionated or dictatorial to others in the team
                    </li>

                    <li>argue openly with others
                    </li>

                    <li>don't work as hard as the others or leave others to do all the work; making them feel as if they
                        are being taken for a 'mug'.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>It is key that the team communicate well and feel like the job is worth completing.</p>

                <p>Treat people how you would like to be treated, with respect, fairness and courtesy. Fulfilling
                    agreements and providing support when it is needed will build on the relationships that have been
                    formed.</p>
