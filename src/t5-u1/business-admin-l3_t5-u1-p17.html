                <p>There are a number of different approaches to delegation and we will explore some of them.</p>

                <p>Tannenbaum and Schmidt’s Continuum of Leadership Behaviour is often referred to as ‘Tells, Sells, Consults and Joins’.</p>

                <p>The continuum provides a wide spectrum of manager behaviours. These start from telling team members
                    what to do following a decision made by the manager all the way through to allowing team members
                    full freedom to make decisions.</p>

                <p>The four main leadership and delegation styles covered by the theory are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tells</strong><br>the manager identifies a problem, makes decisions unilaterally without
                        consulting anyone, and without giving much thought to their team members.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Sells</strong><br>the manager maintains control but spends time persuading the team
                        about the benefits of their decisions.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Consults</strong><br>the manager identifies the problem but does not make the final
                        decision until the team members have suggested solutions.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Joins</strong><br>the manager defines the limits of the possible decisions that can be
                        made by the team, then makes the final decisions along with the team members.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <img src="../images/t5-u1/Leading_People_Tannenbaum_and_Schmidt.png"
                     alt=""
                     style="width:100%;"
                     data-animate="6"/>

                <p>Successful delegation relies on the manager selecting the approach that is best for the situation. Managers will analyse their team members and the tasks, and want to match their delegation approach to the situation.</p>
