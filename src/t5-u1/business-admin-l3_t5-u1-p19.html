                <p>Once the manager, with the team member, has diagnosed the development level for the task, the
                    appropriate style can be applied to the situation. The two variables that create the styles in this
                    model are direction and support.</p>

                <p>Direction is about giving instruction, providing training, setting clear targets and objectives,
                    retaining control over the final decision, providing feedback and monitoring the work being
                    done.</p>

                <p>Support is where the manager helps the team member to gain confidence and motivation as they build
                    their competence through asking questions, providing feedback, offering encouragement and involving
                    them in decision making.</p>

            </section>

            <section>

                <p>It is the mix of different amounts of direction and support that create the four styles. The four
                    styles are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Directing style (S1)</strong> &mdash; here the manager provides high direction and lower
                        levels of support through clear instruction, direction, and by setting the objectives about the
                        task. The manager also monitors the work closely.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Coaching style (S2)</strong> &mdash; in this style the leader still retains control over
                        decisions and will still be defining the task. However they will now ask the team member for
                        suggestions and listen to their concerns or worries about the task and provide support.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Supporting style (S3)</strong> &mdash; the manager now provides more support on the task but
                        much less direction. The support will be through asking questions, listening to concerns,
                        building confidence and motivation, and encouraging the individual to think about and reflect on
                        their work.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Delegating style (S4)</strong> &mdash; the manager is no longer directing and the support
                        levels are reduced. However this does not abdicate the need to still provide the right style of
                        leadership. The manager can encourage the individual to develop their leadership skills and be a
                        role model for others on the task.
                    </li>
                </ul>
