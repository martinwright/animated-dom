                <p>Here is part of the definition of delegation offered by the online business dictionary:</p>

                <p>'Grant of authority by one party (the delegator) to another (the delegatee) for agreed purpose(s) …
                    sharing or transfer of authority and the associated responsibility, from an employer or superior
                    (who has the right to delegate) to an employee or subordinate.'</p>

                <p>The modern manager tends to have a lot on their ‘to-do’ list. From pressing deadlines to reports to
                    write, budgets to plan, people to hire and changes to implement, it is not surprising that the role
                    can, at times, be incredibly busy. One way of alleviating the pressure is to delegate work to
                    others.</p>

                <p>The benefits of delegation are many. Delegation can:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>allow the manager to focus on more strategic and planning-based tasks
                    </li>

                    <li>empower team members to take on more responsibility
                    </li>

                    <li>encourage the development of others in the team
                    </li>

                    <li>enlarge and enrich the roles of others in the team
                    </li>

                    <li>create engagement across the team for the broader team purpose and function.
                    </li>
                </ul>
