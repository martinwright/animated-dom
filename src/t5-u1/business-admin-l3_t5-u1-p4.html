                <div class="p-60">

                <p>Teamwork provides organisations with the ability to complete tasks and projects quicker and more efficiently than with individuals working alone. Co-operation on various tasks reduces workloads for all employees by enabling them to share responsibilities or ideas. Teamwork also reduces the work pressure on every worker, which allows him/her to be thorough in the completion of the assigned roles. In sharing ideas or responsibilities, every employee should have a role that suits their specialisation.</p>

                <p>A team is at their most effective when:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>everyone understands the common goals that they are trying to achieve and appreciates that the
                        team's aims are more important than the individual's
                    </li>

                    <li>everyone has a role in the team and each member understands their role and the skills of others
                    </li>

                    <li>everyone is relaxed in the company of the team members and offers support when it is needed
                    </li>

                    <li>there is trust, respect and open communication
                    </li>

                    <li>everyone shares responsibility for the work.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>All teams must work to achieve the organisation's objectives, so every member of staff needs to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>be aware of the organisation's objectives
                    </li>

                    <li>understand how the work of the team helps to achieve them
                    </li>

                    <li>understand how their own role helps to achieve them.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Every team will have its own targets and objectives that feed into the overall organisation.</p>
