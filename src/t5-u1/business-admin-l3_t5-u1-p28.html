                <p data-animate=“*”>For this aspect of the delegation process we can turn to Hersey and Blanchard and their leadership styles for some insight.</p>

                <p data-animate=“*”><strong>Full delegation</strong> – where a person or team is fully competent (has all the required
                    knowledge and skill) and committed (they are confident and motivated to do it) this is an
                    opportunity to fully delegate a task. In this situation, where very little or no explanation is
                    required by the manager, the responsibility for the task is fully handed over.</p>

                <p data-animate=“*”><strong>Directing</strong> – at the other end of the spectrum, where tasks are being directed very
                    closely, this is less about delegating and more about helping people to learn new tasks they
                    currently cannot do. The levels of directing, telling, explaining, showing, instruction and training
                    will be high initially to help the person or team learn. Although not strictly delegation at this
                    point, it is the starting point of delegation to the team member or team.</p>

                <p data-animate=“*”><strong>Coaching and supporting</strong> – the person or team may have some, or even quite high
                    levels of competence, but is struggling with commitment, motivation and confidence. The level of
                    support required would be high in order to help the person or team to overcome this. Initially,
                    where tasks are discovered to be harder than the delegatee first thought, they will need both
                    support and some direction. Where the person can do the work, but lacks the confidence to accept
                    full delegation, the manager would offer support but less direction.</p>

                <p data-animate=“*”><strong>Monitoring and review</strong> – whether delegating a task completely or partially, there
                    still needs to be an agreement on how the task will be monitored or reviewed. This might involve:
                </p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li>regular meetings/one to ones</li>

                    <li>written reporting on progress</li>

                    <li>updated project management plans and tracking</li>

                    <li>obtaining feedback from stakeholders.</li>
                </ul>
