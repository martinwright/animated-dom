                <p>If tasks are being delegated to stretch and develop people and teams then it is worth considering
                    another dimension to setting goals and objectives for a task; complexity and challenge.</p>

                <p>Edwin Locke and David McClelland posited the idea that achievement was linked to goals that stretch
                    or challenge the individual. This develops them through the task being slightly beyond their comfort
                    zone and current level of mastery.</p>

                <p>Therefore when delegating tasks this encourages us to consider:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The challenge presented by the task</strong><br>is the task difficult but, with effort,
                        still realistic and achievable for the individual or team? Motivation and engagement tend to be
                        enhanced when the level of challenge may be a little daunting but the reward of achievement
                        makes the additional effort required worth it.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>The complexity of the task</strong><br>higher levels of task complexity can provide
                        further challenge, ie a complex project using different skills and abilities across different
                        teams, which can be extremely rewarding to a developing team or individual. One caveat is to
                        ensure the level of complexity is such that it is motivating to the delegatee and not
                        overwhelming.
                    </li>
                </ul>
