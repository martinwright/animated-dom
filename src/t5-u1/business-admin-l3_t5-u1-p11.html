                <p>Belbin suggests that, by understanding your role within a particular team, you can develop your
                    strengths and manage your weaknesses as a team member, and so improve how you contribute to the
                    team. This should create more balance in a team. Read through the team roles below and consider
                    which one you feel you are.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Belbin’s nine types of team roles and how they contribute to performance:</h5>


                <p><strong>Shaper</strong> – they challenge, are dynamic and overcome obstacles. They can be prone to
                    offend and can be easily provoked.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Implementer</strong> – disciplined, reliable, conservative, turns ideas into practical
                    actions. They can be inflexible and slow to respond to change.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Completer finisher</strong> – delivers on time, conscientious, checks for errors and pays
                    attention to detail. They can worry unduly and be reluctant to delegate.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Co-ordinator</strong> – mature, confident, clarifies goals and delegates well. They can be
                    seen as manipulative and offload tasks they don’t like.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Team-worker</strong> – co-operative, mild, perceptive and diplomatic, listens and keeps the
                    peace. They can be indecisive in a crisis.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Resource investigator</strong> – extrovert, enthusiastic, good communicator, explores
                    opportunities and shares information. They can be over optimistic and lose interest quickly.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Plant</strong> – creative, imaginative, solves difficult problems. They can be prone to
                    ignoring details and are too preoccupied to communicate well.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Monitor evaluator</strong> – strategic, sees all opinions and is accurate. They tend to lack
                    drive or the ability to inspire.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Specialist</strong> – single-minded, self-starter, dedicated and brings knowledge. They are
                    prone to only working within narrow parameters and dwell on technicalities.
                </p>


                <p>Belbin’s theory is a tool for leaders to help them recognise the diversity in their teams.</p>
