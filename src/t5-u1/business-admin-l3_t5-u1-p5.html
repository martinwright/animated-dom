                <div class="p-60">

                <p>It is important to understand how <strong>teams differ from groups</strong> in the workplace:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A group is a collection of individuals who co-ordinate their individual efforts.
                    </li>

                    <li>A team is a group of people who have a common team purpose and challenging goals. Team members
                        are mutually committed to the goals and to each other.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The difference between a group and a team can be illustrated by looking at the examples of a high
                    street bank cashier and a surgeon. Both employees have a clear focus on what is required of them but
                    there are several important differences in the way that they work.</p>

                <p>The cashier that serves you when you are paying in money is one of a number of cashiers. The role of
                    each cashier is to provide customers with a number of services. Each cashier, however, works
                    independently. The cashiers in a bank could be described as a work <strong>group.</strong></p>

                <p>However, a surgeon works as part of a team in the operating theatre. The surgeon, the anaesthetist,
                    the nurse and the junior doctor all have distinct roles. These roles are complementary and
                    interdependant. The surgical procedure could not be undertaken effectively without each member of
                    the <strong>team</strong> co-operating fully.</p>

                <p>Organisations use both groups and teams depending on the work to be undertaken.</p>
