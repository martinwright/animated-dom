                <p>An effective team is one where, according to Meredith Belbin, the team roles needed for success are
                    delivered by those most suited to deliver them. Belbin makes the distinction between team functional
                    roles and team roles. Team functional roles are the hard operational and technical skills a person
                    has to deliver in their job. Team roles, on the other hand, are behaviours through which the
                    individual contributes to the team.</p>

                <p>For example, two members of a finance team might have shared responsibility for credit control
                    (functional role). However one of these people may be excellent at solving challenging problems with
                    creative ideas (team role: Plant, see below) and the other might be better at building co-operation
                    within the team and fostering collaboration (team role: Teamworker). This clearly has an implication
                    for the types of task that could be delegated to these people.</p>

                <p>The Belbin assessment provides graphical information about team role preferences and their meanings
                    and impacts. As a reminder here is an overview of the nine team roles:</p>

                <ul>
                <li><strong>Completer finisher</strong><br>works to a very high level of detail on a task to its
                    completion although can get bogged down in the detail.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Co-ordinator</strong><br>calm and mature, clarifies objectives and tasks and can
                    effectively delegate work to individuals although at times can be prone to being manipulative.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Plant</strong><br>able to solve problems through innovation and creativity, able to
                    generate ideas although can struggle to communicate.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Shaper</strong><br>driving and dynamic, often extrovert and able to influence, although
                    can at times offend othersâ€™ feelings.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Monitor evaluator</strong><br>provides cool-headed realistic views often from the wider
                    perspective. Although good at analysis, can be prone to being overly critical.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Teamworker</strong><br>works hard to maintain team harmony and cohesion, however may
                    avoid difficult situations.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Implementer</strong><br>takes an idea and turns it into hard action, uses a practical
                    approach to getting things done although can be resistant to change.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Resource investigators</strong><br>high ability to network and build contacts/find
                    resources, has the tendency to lose energy once initial excitement for a task passes.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Specialist</strong><br>has strong knowledge in important areas for the team, which is
                    highly useful but can mean they get bogged down in the technicalities.
                </li>
            </ul>

                <p>These different models provide us with frameworks to help us understand what work to delegate and to
                    whom. We may have people and teams that are competent to delegate the responsibility for entire
                    tasks to, knowing they will carry them out successfully. We may also have people and teams that,
                    whilst tasks can be delegated, may require us to retain some control over decisions or provide
                    higher levels of support to assist.</p>
