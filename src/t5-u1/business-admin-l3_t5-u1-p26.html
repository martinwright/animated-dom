                <h4 data-animate="2">12 Set clear goals, objectives and levels of responsibility</h4>

                <p>Before delegating and assigning tasks to the person or team taking them on, there needs to be clarity
                    as to the specific nature of the work, boundaries, reporting and measures of success. This is where
                    an explanation of the task is required – set and agree goals, objectives, and levels of
                    responsibility and reporting.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Explaining the task</h5>

                <p>The level of explanation required will depend on the experience and skill level of the person or team
                    the task is being delegated to. Hersey and Blanchard’s model shows there will be people who will
                    need a lot of explanation about tasks (D1) and those who, once told what the task is, can just get
                    on with it (D4) and variations in between (D2 and D3).</p>

                <p>Explaining what needs to be done can be a barrier to effective delegation due to the time this can
                    take. Poor or incomplete explanations will create problems further upstream, whereas if someone who
                    already knows what to do receives too much explanation it may erode trust.</p>

                <p>Hersey and Blanchard’s model provides us with guidance in this area in terms of matching the needs of
                    the individual in relation to the task with the amount of control to be retained by the
                    manager. </p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Setting and agreeing goals and objectives</h5>

                <p>This step is to ensure all parties to the delegation understand what is expected and how the
                    objectives and goals will be measured. SMART provides us with a useful framework for this. In this
                    context we can use SMART as follows:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Specific</strong> &mdash; ensure that the details of the task are understood, what it aims to
                        do, clarify what the key actions are and review any deadlines and milestones already
                        established.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Measurable</strong> &mdash; by being specific about the task, the ways it will be measured
                        will become evident.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Agreed</strong> &mdash; both the manager and the delegatee agree on the task, its content and
                        what is to be done.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Realistic</strong> &mdash; this is a useful checkpoint to ensure that all parties believe the
                        person or team being delegated to have the control and influence needed to get the work done, as
                        well as the required skills and competencies.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Time-bound</strong> &mdash; this includes the specific dates for milestones and deadlines
                        agreed for completion of the task.
                    </li>
                </ul>
