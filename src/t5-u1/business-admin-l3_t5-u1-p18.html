                <h4 data-animate="2">4 Hersey and Blanchard’s Situational Leadership Model</h4>

                <p>This model of leadership was developed by Paul Hersey and Kenneth Blanchard during the 1960s and has
                    become a very popular workplace leadership and management model offering us four styles of
                    leadership that the manager can apply in different situations when working with and delegating tasks
                    to their team members.</p>

                <p>Much like Tannenbaum and Schmidt, this model provides a context to understand different approaches to
                    delegation depending on the factors of competence and commitment that a team member has towards a
                    task.</p>

                <p>The four different situations for delegating work in this model are described as <strong>development
                    levels</strong> and relate to the team member’s <strong>competence</strong> and their <strong>commitment</strong>
                    towards successfully completing a task.</p>

                <p><strong>Competence</strong> is described as transferable skills and knowledge that can be used to
                    complete a task.</p>

                <p><strong>Commitment</strong> is described as a mixture of motivation to do the task and the confidence
                    the individual has about doing it.</p>

                <p>It is this mixture of competence and commitment that the team member has towards a task that allows
                    the manager to diagnose the situation and apply an appropriate delegation style. The four
                    combinations or task development levels are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Development level 1 (D1)</strong><br>what Blanchard calls ‘the enthusiastic beginner’
                        has high commitment but no or low competence and so whilst new to the task they are enthusiastic
                        about learning to do it.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Development level 2 (D2)</strong><br>‘the disillusioned learner’ has gained some
                        competence but is now finding the task harder than they thought it would be. They may become
                        frustrated and lose commitment towards the task.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Development level 3 (D3)</strong><br>‘capable but cautious’ means the individual has
                        gained significantly more competence or can do the task, but is struggling with commitment and
                        therefore may lack the confidence and/or motivation to see the task through to the finish.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Development level 4 (D4)</strong><br>the self-reliant achiever is now both competent and
                        committed to the task and perhaps is seen as someone who is an expert and who can help others
                        through the development levels on the same task. The full task can be delegated to D4.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <section>

                <figure class="shape-100" data-animate="2" style="position: relative; top:-1em; right:-1em; z-index: -2">
                    <img src="../images/t5-u1/_m_effective_delegation_book2_02.jpg" />

                    <figure class="shape-15" data-animate="9" style="opacity:.9; left:10%; bottom: 10%;">
                        <img src="../images/_shapes/pen-s10.svg" />
                    </figure>

                </figure>

                <p>We can see the journey that a person will take upon carrying out a new task through these development
                    levels. People will be working on different tasks and may be at different levels. For some tasks
                    they might be ‘D1’ – new to but excited, and others at ‘D4’ – willing and fully able to do the
                    task.</p>

                <p>This clearly impacts the manager’s ability to delegate work. Team members at D1 will need the work to
                    be clearly defined and require higher levels of close supervision with the decisions still being the
                    responsibility of the manager. At the other end of the spectrum, where a person is at D4 and fully
                    committed and competent, the task can be fully delegated to them. Development levels D2 and D3
                    represent variations of a stage where some competence exists to do the task but the manager retains
                    some control whilst the person gains the experience and commitment to get to D4.</p>

                <p>The leader/manager therefore has to decide, through discussions with the team member, what style to
                    apply once they have <strong>diagnosed the development level</strong> the person is at for the
                    particular task being undertaken.</p>
