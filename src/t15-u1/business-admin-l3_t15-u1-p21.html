                <h4 data-animate="2">11 Copyright and intellectual property</h4>

                <div class="p-80">

                <p>The Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 limits what you can copy or distribute to others. An
                    author automatically owns the copyright to any material/book they write provided ‘they have expended
                    more than negligible labour, skill and effort in the creation of the work’. (www.ipo.gov.uk)</p>

                <p>You can only use extracts from the material or book under certain circumstances, eg if you
                    acknowledge the source of the material, ie the author, the title, the date it was published and the
                    publisher’s name. Photocopying is also not permissible unless the document or book states otherwise.
                    Using newspaper or magazine cuttings also requires the permission of the publication they appeared
                    in and copyright also covers music, films and TV broadcasts.</p>

                <p>The four main types of Intellectual Property (IP) are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Patents for inventions – new and improved products and processes that are capable of industrial
                        application.
                    </li>

                    <li>Trademarks for brand identity – of goods and services allowing distinctions to be made between
                        different traders.
                    </li>

                    <li>Designs for product appearance – of the whole or a part of a product resulting from the features
                        of, in particular, the lines, contours, colours, shape, texture or materials of the product
                        itself or its ornamentation.
                    </li>

                    <li>Copyright for material – literary and artistic material, music, films, sound recordings and
                        broadcasts, including software and multimedia.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="4">The government’s intellectual property web site <a href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/" target="_blank">www.ipo.gov.uk</a>
                    states that: ‘Intellectual property,
                    often known as IP, allows people to own their creativity and innovation in the same way that they
                    can own physical property. The owner of IP can control and be rewarded for its use, and this
                    encourages further innovation and creativity to the benefit of us all'.</p>

                <p>Whilst patents, registered designs and trademarks need to be applied for, you will only get
                    protection if what you have is something that can be protected by these types of IP. The UK Patent
                    Office accepts applications and grants rights in each of these areas.</p>
