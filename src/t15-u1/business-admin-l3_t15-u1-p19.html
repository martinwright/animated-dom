                <p>Tips to help you find files quickly:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>name them appropriately
                    </li>

                    <li>store them correctly in folders (directories) according to content.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Here are some precautions against unexpected data loss:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>autosave
                    </li>

                    <li>back up
                    </li>

                    <li>write protect by changing the file properties
                    </li>

                    <li>individual files can be password protected to prevent unauthorised access or changes.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>It is useful to print the name and location of the file in a footer, this is an auto feature of most
                    software packages.</p>

                <p><strong>Autosave</strong> – this is a feature whereby a copy of the file on screen is automatically
                    saved to a
                    temporary location so that, in the event of power loss, the file can be recovered. The interval
                    between autosaves can be adjusted.</p>

                <p><strong>Back-ups</strong> – it is sensible to have a copy of any file in case the original is lost or
                    corrupted. In
                    most organisations, the files saved on the network server will be copied (backed up) every night
                    onto a separate storage area. In the case of corruption or loss, data can then be retrieved from the
                    copied files. It is still sensible to have your own copy of any important files (as this will save
                    you the time and embarrassment if you accidentally delete a file and have to wait for a copy to be
                    found by IT technicians). The use of portable, external hard drives and USB flash drives are a
                    suitable way to store back-up copies, assuming your organisation approves of their use.</p>

                <p>Ease of editing files means that sometimes data content may be lost accidentally. This can be
                    prevented by write-protecting a file. Read only, allows the file to be opened and read but no
                    changes may be saved to it. (Of course you could save any changes made but with a new name,
                    therefore preserving the original version.) This ensures the safety of a file.</p>
