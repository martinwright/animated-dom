                <p>How many voluntary organisations can you name?</p>

                <p>Voluntary sector organisations undertake social activity as their aim and are not for profit. They
                    are sometimes referred to as the community or third sector. This sector also includes organisations
                    which operate under charitable status, but whose income is invested back into the operation rather
                    than being raised on behalf of a cause, eg City & Guilds.</p>

                <p>Charitable organisations are a type of non-profit organisation (NPO). They differ from other types of
                    NPOs in that they centre on non-profit and philanthropic (love of humanity) goals as well as social
                    well-being (eg charitable, educational, religious or other activities serving the public interest or
                    common good). Charities are registered at the Charities Commission.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">The government offers advice about setting up a <a
                        href="https://www.gov.uk/setting-up-charity">charity</a> and how non-profit organisations can
                    set up <a href="https://www.gov.uk/set-up-a-social-enterprise">social enterprise</a> businesses that
                    have social, charitable or community-based objectives.</p>

                <p>There are four common charitable structures:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>unincorporated associations
                    </li>

                    <li>charitable trusts
                    </li>

                    <li>charitable incorporated organisations
                    </li>

                    <li>charitable companies.
                    </li>
