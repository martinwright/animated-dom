                    data-animate="2">3 Data entry accuracy</h4>

                <p data-animate="4">Data entry is an important part of many job roles and accuracy is important to enable appropriate communications, reporting and decision making. Data entry operators are required to handle huge amounts of data each day, as quickly as possible, increasing the possibility of errors.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">Inaccurate data entry can result in poor decision making, increased costs for correction and a poor experience for customers.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">You can improve the accuracy of data entry in a number of ways.</p>

                <h5 class="sub-heading"
                    data-animate="2">Data sources</h5>

                <p data-animate="4">It is important to identify the internal or external sources of any data inaccuracy. This may be inaccurate values, communication between databases and time-bound changes (eg marital status, age). By identifying the source of inaccuracies, organisations can then take steps to reduce future issues.</p>

                <h5 class="sub-heading"
                    data-animate="2">Goals</h5>

                <p data-animate="4">Managers should set realistic goals for data entry teams to improve their accuracy. Efficient data capture, data entry and coding can support with evaluation of the goals set.</p>

                <h5 class="sub-heading"
                    data-animate="2">Software</h5>

                <p data-animate="4">Software tools, including optical character recognition (OCR) and intelligent character recognition (ICR), can reduce data entry workloads as they automatically read and extract data. This ensures fewer typing mistakes and more time for analysis of data.</p>

                <h5 class="sub-heading"
                    data-animate="2">Accuracy not speed</h5>

                <p data-animate="4">All data entry teams are required to work at speed but goals need to be set appropriately so that accuracy can be maintained. Rushed data entry leads to more mistakes.</p>

                <h5 class="sub-heading"
                    data-animate="2">Pressure</h5>

                <p data-animate="4">Managers need to ensure that data entry teams are not under pressure to meet unrealistic targets. Overloaded data entry teams become tired, which increases errors. Delegation of work and recruiting additional staff at key pressure points can help reduce pressure on individuals.</p>

                <h5 class="sub-heading"
                    data-animate="2">Review</h5>

                <p data-animate="4">Organisations need to have processes in place to review and check data entry. Quality assurance of data entry removes errors and helps identify where inaccuracies are occurring. Any training, process or system issues can then be actioned.</p>

                <h5 class="sub-heading"
                    data-animate="2">Error reporting</h5>

                <p data-animate="4">Validation and automated error reports can be used to improve data entry accuracy. For example, software may be enabled to only allow the input of national insurance numbers which meet the correct format. If incorrect digits are entered this should alert the operator or managers.</p>

                <h5 class="sub-heading"
                    data-animate="2">Why data is important</h5>

                <p data-animate="4">Data entry operators should be trained to understand the role and importance of the data they are working with and the implications of inaccuracies for the organisation and its customers. This improves individual responsibility and effectiveness.</p>

                <h5 class="sub-heading"
                    data-animate="2">Standards</h5>

                <p data-animate="4">Many organisations use data accuracy standards including data monitoring, matching, geo-coding, data profiling and linking to ensure conformity with pre-defined standards.</p>

                <h5 class="sub-heading"
                    data-animate="2">Environment</h5>

                <p data-animate="4">Healthy and active people make less mistakes and retain focus. Therefore the work environment for data entry operators needs to be appropriate. This might include ergonomic chairs and regular rest breaks.  </p>
