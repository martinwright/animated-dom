                <p>It is important to have <strong>clear objectives</strong> about what needs to be achieved during
                    the conversation. The person leading the meeting needs to have a clear vision of the <strong>desired
                        outcomes</strong> – the main focus and goals.
                </p>

                <p>For example, if a manager needs to have a challenging conversation with a customer who has made
                    a complaint, the main objectives could be to:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>build a rapport with the customer
                    </li>

                    <li>identify the problem
                    </li>

                    <li>agree and implement solutions
                    </li>

                    <li>take follow-up action – including reviewing policies and procedures to improve the organisation’s output.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>In this example, the manager’s desired outcomes are to have a satisfied customer and reduced complaints in the future.</p>

                <p>Clear objectives help us to focus on the issues that need to be resolved and give us a guide about
                    how the meeting needs to progress. By concentrating on goals, facts and options, we can shift the
                    focus away from the individuals involved, which should reduce anxiety and negative emotions and
                    increase the chances of a successful outcome.</p>
