                <img src="../images/t5-u3/effective_feedback_12.jpg"
                     alt=""

                     data-animate="6"/>

                <p>For feedback to be useful, it needs to be <strong>constructive</strong>, <strong>not
                    destructive</strong>. If there are problems and weaknesses that need to be addressed, people need to
                    be advised of these tactfully and shown how to improve.</p>

                <p>People can see feedback as criticism and may react negatively. They can become defensive, make
                    excuses, choose not to hear or take the feedback seriously. Destructive or negative feedback that is
                    handled poorly can leave people feeling bad, hopeless and worthless. They can feel they are left
                    without any useful information or ideas on which they can build.</p>

                <p>However, people often respond positively to constructive feedback because it concentrates on, for
                    example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>the individualâ€™s needs and abilities</strong><br>increasing self-awareness and offering
                        them what they need to develop in the workplace
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>positive messages</strong><br>providing useful information about performance and how to
                        develop
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>being supportive</strong><br>offering encouragement and developing working relationships
                        and trust
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>behaviours and actions rather than the person</strong><br>making the issues less
                        personal
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>helping people to feel valued, respected and engaged in the workplace processes</strong><br>to
                        aid team-building and motivation.
                    </li>
                </ul>
