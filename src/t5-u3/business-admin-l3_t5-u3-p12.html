                <p>A manager who is dealing with a complaining customer needs to diffuse the situation, make the
                    conversation less challenging and maximise the chances of a successful outcome. They may concentrate
                    on:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>having an open and non-confrontational posture
                    </li>

                    <li>being polite, courteous, patient, apologetic and confident – to inspire trust
                    </li>

                    <li>listening more than they speak – using active listening skills
                    </li>

                    <li>using a calm, polite, respectful but confident tone of voice
                    </li>

                    <li>using open, closed and rhetorical questions – maybe with probing questions if more detail is required.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>On the other hand, a manager who is giving a second verbal warning to a team member may choose to use
                    a more assertive approach. They still need to be polite, but they may also concentrate on:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>using dominant body language – such as strong eye contact
                    </li>

                    <li>good speaking skills with a strong tone of voice
                    </li>

                    <li>being firm and assertive
                    </li>

                    <li>expressing their disappointment – that the first verbal warning did not seem to work
                    </li>

                    <li>a range of question types – including leading and probing questions.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Communication methods and styles need to be calm, fair and professional so that, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>everyone concerned can work together afterwards
                    </li>

                    <li>the challenging conversation is less likely to lead on to further complaints or accusations of harassment and bullying
                    </li>

                    <li>the good reputation of the individuals and the organisation are maintained.
                    </li>
                </ul>
