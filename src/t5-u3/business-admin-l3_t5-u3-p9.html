                <img src="../images/t5-u3/techniques_for_managing_02.jpg"
                     alt=""

                     data-animate="6"/>

                <p>The environment needs to be suitable for the people who will have the challenging conversation, if at
                    all possible. A suitable environment has several benefits. For example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>the people having the conversation feel at ease, safer and less threatened
                    </li>

                    <li>if there are emotional outbursts, they are not in front of other people, such as colleagues or
                        other customers
                    </li>

                    <li>they give a professional image of the organisation and its staff.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>Ideally, the area needs to be:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>quiet</strong><br>away from other people, distractions and excessive noise
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>private</strong><br>so that confidentiality is not breached.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>In addition to the room itself, we need to think about other things that support the meeting and
                    improve accessibility for all. These might include, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>general accessibility to the building</strong><br>eg ramps, lifts, wide doors and
                        corridors to make access simpler for people with walking difficulties or who use wheelchairs or
                        pushchairs
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>assistance for people with hearing or sight difficulties</strong><br>eg a quiet area
                        away from background noise; using large print, symbols, graphics or Braille on supporting
                        information
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>translation services</strong><br>eg where there are legal implications, such as in a
                        police station following arrest.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The environment can also be changed to make the meeting more challenging. For example, if the person
                    leading the meeting needs to be in a dominant position, they can arrange the seating, lighting and
                    so on to support their status â€“ eg sitting in a large, comfortable chair and having the other person
                    on a small, low chair or standing up; avoiding soft, relaxing lighting; sitting behind a large desk
                    that acts as a barrier.</p>
