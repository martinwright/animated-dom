                <h4 data-animate="2">3 Using emotional intelligence</h4>

                <p>Whatever our approach, we need make allowances for the other person’s feelings when managing
                    challenging conversations. The chances are that they will be nervous, afraid, uncomfortable,
                    aggressive or defensive. By using our emotional intelligence, we can read their feelings and
                    reactions more accurately and adapt our approach and employ appropriate skills.</p>

                <p>People can be challenging to deal with for many reasons. They may have, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>additional needs or requirements – eg impaired vision, hearing or mobility issues
                    </li>

                    <li>poor communication skills – eg learning difficulties that make communication difficult
                    </li>

                    <li>language or cultural barriers – eg making them upset because they find it hard to express themselves in English
                    </li>

                    <li>personal problems – eg issues with alcohol, drugs or a medical condition; childcare or family problems; difficult living conditions
                    </li>

                    <li>an incident, emergency or trauma – eg reacting badly if they (or a person close to them) have been involved in an accident, injury or serious illness
                    </li>

                    <li>dissatisfaction and disappointment – eg reacting emotionally when there is a problem with the product or service
                    </li>

                    <li>impatience – eg being short-tempered if they are not dealt with straight away
                    </li>

                    <li>indecision – eg uncertainty about how to proceed, what they want or how to solve problems
                    </li>

                    <li>being overly assertive, confident or intimidating – eg coming across as a bully when talking
                    </li>

                    <li>being too talkative – eg making problems unnecessarily complicated, hard to identify and deal with.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>By being aware of background information, it is possible to use our emotional intelligence to ‘step
                    into their shoes’, understand their viewpoint and take appropriate measures to achieve the
                    objectives of the conversation. This skill of using empathy and understanding can be extremely
                    useful. It helps us to amend our approach, diffuse problems and use the listening, speaking and
                    questioning techniques that will be most effective. </p>

                <p>We also need to be aware that some people find it extremely hard to use and understand emotional
                    intelligence, and we cannot assume that we all have the same ability to ‘put ourselves in someone
                    else’s shoes’ when we are involved with challenging conversations.</p>
