                <h4 data-animate="2">1 Introduction</h4>

                <p>Having a good, all-round view of a problem is critical when solving problems. The more information
                    and data you have at your disposal, the more informed you will be, making you more likely to find a
                    solution.</p>

                <p>When assessing the nature, scope and impact of a problem, you need to go through a variety of
                    processes that are similar to those made by a doctor when making a diagnosis. When working out what
                    may be wrong with the patient, a doctor needs to, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>look at the patient
                    </li>

                    <li>ask them questions
                    </li>

                    <li>perform examinations – eg checking mobility or taking their temperature
                    </li>

                    <li>assess the scope and impact of the problems – eg taking urgent action for serious or life-threatening conditions
                    </li>

                    <li>perform or request further tests – eg blood tests or scans
                    </li>

                    <li>research extra information if they cannot make an instant diagnosis
                    </li>

                    <li>consult with colleagues
                    </li>

                    <li>ask specialists for advice and guidance – eg sending the patient to hospital for more in-depth tests.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Very often, the diagnosis can be made and a treatment plan can be put in place. Sometimes the
                    diagnosis is not straightforward, and the medical team will have to try different options before the
                    best form of treatment can be found.</p>

                <p>The same sorts of processes apply in problem solving. You need to investigate and assess problems
                    thoroughly before you can make decisions about the possible solutions.</p>

                <p>Examples of problems include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>equipment failure</strong><br>eg production machinery, lifts, ITC equipment or vehicles
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>accidents involving equipment</strong><br>eg using equipment incorrectly and damaging it
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>accidents involving people</strong><br>eg staff or customers having slips, trips and
                        falls in the workplace; injuries after lifting incorrectly; ladders and steps slipping
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>problems with physical resources</strong><br>eg insufficient resources; delays in the
                        supply chain; damaged goods; poor-quality supplies; late or missing deliveries
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>problems with human resources</strong><br>eg insufficient skills, knowledge or
                        experience to be able to deal with tasks; staff absences causing delays and cancellations
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>missed deadlines</strong><br>eg failing to deliver tasks, products, services or reports
                        on time due to poor time management, bad weather or staff problems
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>customer complaints</strong><br>eg faulty goods; late deliveries of products; receiving
                        rude service; not having their telephone calls answered quickly; letters and emails not being
                        answered
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>difficulties with working relationships between colleagues</strong><br>eg arguments or
                        disharmony within a team; harassment, bullying or discrimination; communication problems.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>On the next few pages we'll explore the first things that you need to examine when analysing problems.</p>
