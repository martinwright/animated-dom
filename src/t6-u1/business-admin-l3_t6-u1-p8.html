                <h2 data-animate="2">When to escalate problems</h2>

                <p data-animate=“*”>Working within the limits of authority is important, and this applies to managing challenging
                    conversations as well. We all need to know when to escalate a problem to someone else. The limits of
                    authority, and how to escalate a problem that is outside those limits, will be set out in, for
                    example:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li>the employment contract
                    </li>

                    <li>the job description
                    </li>

                    <li>organisational policies, procedures or standards
                    </li>

                    <li>training materials.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate=“*”>The organisation’s procedures will show when you need to escalate a problem. For example:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li>when a decision is needed that is outside your limits of authority
                    </li>

                    <li>when a customer or another stakeholder requests something that is outside the limits of your responsibility
                    </li>

                    <li>when dealing with complaints or problems that are outside the limits of authority
                    </li>

                    <li>when you do not have enough knowledge, experience or skill to be able to deal with something on your own
                    </li>

                    <li>when there is not enough time to deal with something properly
                    </li>

                    <li>when there is a threat to health and safety – eg if someone becomes aggressive, very upset or
                        unwell during a challenging conversation.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <img src="../images/t6-u1/managing_challenging_conversations_01_b.jpg" />

                    <figure class="shape-20" data-animate="9" data-type="zoom-in" style="opacity:.9; left:44%; bottom: -13%;">

                <p data-animate=“*”>The job titles can vary, but employment contracts, job descriptions and training materials should
                    show the chain of command, or management structure, of the organisation. For example:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li>team members will usually escalate problems to their team leader, or supervisor
                    </li>

                    <li>team leaders and supervisors might refer a problem to their shift manager or a specialist from
                        another department – eg quality control team leader for help with product testing
                    </li>

                    <li>managers will escalate to more senior managers or subject specialists.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate=“*”>Working within the limits of authority and escalating problems when appropriate protects:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li>the people involved with the conversation – by making sure that they act legally and are fully
                        supported in their decisions and promises if they have worked in line with the organisational
                        procedures; by making sure that their legal rights have been observed and respected
                    </li>

                    <li>the organisation – helping it to maintain a good reputation for being fair and consistent.
                    </li>
                </ul>
