                <img src="../images/t6-u1/understanding_the_nature_04.jpg"
                     alt=""

                     data-animate="6"/>

                <p>The impact of the problem is the knock-on effect of the problem. You need to be able to step back and
                    analyse everything objectively, and to consider the wider impact of the problem and the possible
                    solutions. This helps you to work out plans and strategies about how to overcome the problem.</p>

                <p>The impact of problems can vary and it might not be possible to predict every outcome. The best that
                    you can do if you cannot assess the full impact of a problem is:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>work on the basis of the impact being minimal – and plan actions and solutions for the best
                        outcome
                    </li>

                    <li>be ready for maximum impact – and have outline plans in case you have to deal with the worst
                        outcome.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Some problems only have a <strong>short-term impact</strong>. If temporary solutions can be found, or
                    if the problem is routine and can be fixed quickly, the short-term impact might be minimal.</p>

                <p>Some problems have a <strong>long-term impact</strong>. The problems might be very difficult and
                    expensive to solve and there could be a long-term impact and far-reaching consequences on finances,
                    jobs, customer relations, the local area and so on.</p>

                <p>Following our office fire example again, if the fire is put out quickly with no injuries or major
                    damage, the impact effects could include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>disruption to that day’s activities only
                    </li>

                    <li>inspections by fire officers and health and safety experts before being allowed to use the office again
                    </li>

                    <li>time spent cleaning up and redecorating if necessary
                    </li>

                    <li>some lost materials – eg paper
                    </li>

                    <li>staff being upset but unhurt and unaffected by smoke due to a swift exit or extinguishing of the fire
                    </li>

                    <li>replacing fire-fighting equipment immediately
                    </li>

                    <li>operational changes following analysis of the causes of the fire.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>If the fire cannot be put out quickly and safely and spreads to the entire factory that employs 100
                    people, the impact effects could also include, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>short-term emergency medical care for a large number of people
                    </li>

                    <li>long-term health issues for some people – eg lung damage after smoke inhalation
                    </li>

                    <li>destruction of the whole building and its contents
                    </li>

                    <li>long and detailed investigations by police, fire officers, insurance assessors, health and
                        safety specialists, legal representatives and others
                    </li>

                    <li>serious financial and legal consequences for the organisation, directors, managers and others
                    </li>

                    <li>loss of jobs for all employees if the business cannot recover.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>This example is extreme, but it does show how far-reaching the scope and impact of a problem can be.</p>
