                     alt=""
                     style="width:100%;"
                     data-animate="6"/>

                <p>Having full details about the nature of the problem enables you to assess the scope of the problem.</p>

                <p>When considering the scope of a problem, you need to look at the potential size of the problem.</p>

                <p>For example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Exactly what is affected? – eg a small work area or the whole building; the stock on a shelf or
                        a full warehouse that contains six months’ supply of materials; the budget and deadlines.
                    </li>

                    <li>Exactly who is affected? – eg one person, a small team, a large department or the whole
                        organisation; suppliers or customers; two people or 20,000 people?
                    </li>

                    <li>Who might be able to solve the problem? – eg are solutions within the scope of your limits of
                        authority, or will senior managers and external specialists be required?
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>In this process, you will look at how big the problem is, or how big it could be. You will look at
                    how far the problem could affect, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>your team and others in the organisation
                    </li>

                    <li>customers and suppliers
                    </li>

                    <li>production and delivery of goods and services
                    </li>

                    <li>the building, infrastructure, machinery and equipment
                    </li>

                    <li>objectives, deadlines and budgets.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>In the same example, if there is a fire in an office, there is scope for the fire to spread
                    throughout the rest of the building, threaten the health and safety of anyone in the area, destroy
                    equipment, machinery and supplies, and destroy jobs, customer relations and the business.</p>
