                <h2 data-animate="2">Price elasticity of demand</h2>

                <div class="p-60">

                <p>Price elasticity of demand (PED) is a measure of the extent to which demand for goods or services is
                    responsive to price changes. Price elasticity of demand depends on how <em>essential</em> the good
                    or service is. Is it viewed as a luxury or necessity?</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Luxury goods = elastic.
                    </li>

                    <li>Essential = inelastic.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>The law of demand states that as price rises, demand falls. Therefore, PED will always have a negative value.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Factors affecting PED</h5>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Necessity of the good/service</strong> &mdash; the more essential it is, the lower its
                        elasticity.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Number of available substitutes</strong> &mdash; the more substitutes available, the higher
                        its elasticity.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Addictiveness</strong> &mdash; habit forming goods, such as alcohol, can be highly inelastic.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Cost and usefulness</strong> &mdash; the smaller the proportion of income that is spent on
                        cheap/useful goods, the more inelastic they will be.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Time period</strong> &mdash; in the short run, demand is more inelastic; in the long run, it
                        tends to be more elastic.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Consumer awareness</strong> &mdash; more information leads to higher elasticity.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Supply and demand</h5>

                <p>For most goods and services the relationship between demand and price is inverse – when price is
                    high, demand is low; when price is low, demand is high. Demand is also affected by a range of other
                    factors such as disposable income and advertising.</p>

                <p>For most goods and services, the relationship between supply and price is positive – when price is
                    low, demand is low; when price is high, demand is high and vice versa. Supply is affected by a range
                    of other factors such as technological development and taxes/subsidies.</p>
