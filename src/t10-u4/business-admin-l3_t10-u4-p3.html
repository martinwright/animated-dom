                </figure>

                <p>Market structures can be categorised as follows:</p>

                <ul data-animate="*">
                    <li data-animate="*"><strong>Perfect competition</strong> &ndash; is largely ‘theoretical’ and rarely found in business.
                        Each business operating in the specific market is referred to as a <strong>price taker</strong>
                        as they have no individual influence on the price at which the goods or services produced are
                        sold.
                    </li>

                    <li data-animate="*"><strong>Monopoly</strong> &ndash; those businesses which have managed to gain complete control of the
                        market operate in a <strong>pure monopoly</strong> market structure. This represents the
                        opposite of perfect competition as the market is comprised of only <strong>one business
                            organisation</strong>. This position of dominance is maintained through the use of <strong>barriers
                            to entry</strong> which limit the ability of rivals to enter the market. Any industry can be
                        defined as a monopoly if one of the firms competing in that industry controls <strong>more than
                            25% of the market</strong>. Having such a large share of the market lends the firm the
                        ability to <strong>price discriminate</strong> which involves charging different prices for what
                        is the essentially the same good or service, eg an Internet provider charges different prices
                        for different levels of service. Prior to deregulation, public utilities in the UK were examples
                        of monopolies, eg BT and Southern Water. Monopolies are regarded as dangerous for the consumer
                        as the firms involved have the ability to overcharge. Their practices are regulated in the UK by
                        the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/competition-and-markets-authority" target="_blank">Competition
                            and Markets Authority</a>.
                    </li>


                    <li data-animate="*"><strong>Oligopoly</strong> &ndash; an oligopoly is a market which is made up of a <strong>few
                        large</strong> firms. The firms operating in this type of market structure sell similar goods or
                        services and are referred to as <strong>price shapers</strong>, ie they have some control over
                        the prices charged to customers. In the UK, although there are six large firms which dominate
                        the energy market (Ofcom, 2017), with over 78% of consumers, there are lots of other businesses
                        operating in the same sector.
                    </li>

                    <li data-animate="*"><strong>Monopolistic competition</strong> &ndash; this type of market structure exhibits features of
                        both monopoly and perfect competition. It is ‘competitive’ in the sense that there are a
                        <strong>large number of firms</strong> and there is <strong>freedom of entry</strong> into the
                        market. Each business produces goods or services that are <strong>slightly different</strong>
                        and this allows them to have greater control over pricing, market share and profits. The
                        <strong>product differentiation</strong> feature of this type of market is what makes it
                        monopolistic in nature. As in oligopoly, monopolistic competitive businesses are referred to as
                        <strong>price shapers</strong>, ie they have some degree of control over the price at which
                        goods or services are sold. Product differentiation encourages a degree of <strong>brand
                            loyalty</strong> amongst customers and this makes the demand for the good/service
                        effectively more inelastic.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="*">Each of the above market types have <strong>two</strong> main differences:</p>

                <ol data-animate="*">
                    <li>The <strong>amount of competition</strong> that exists between the businesses involved in the market.
                    </li>

                    <li>The level to which the business <strong>determines the price</strong> of the good or service it produces.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p data-animate="*">The competitiveness of each market type is illustrated below:</p>

                <img src="../images/t10-u4/Market_structure_and_competition.png"
                     alt=""
                     style="width:100%;"
                     data-animate="6"/>

                <p data-animate="*">Competition increases left to right, with monopoly the least competitive and perfect competition the most.</p>

                <ul data-animate="*">
                    <li>Market structure is determined by the <strong>amount of competition</strong> and <strong>control
                        over pricing</strong> exercised by firms.
                    </li>

                    <li>Businesses that operate in perfectly competitive markets are called <strong>price
                        takers</strong> as they have <strong>no control</strong> over the price charged. These markets
                        are rarely seen in the real business world.
                    </li>

                    <li>Businesses that operate in monopolistic markets are called <strong>price makers</strong>. This
                        is because they have <strong>full control</strong> over prices charged.
                    </li>

                    <li>Businesses that operate in oligopolistic and monopolistically competitive markets are called
                        <strong>price shapers</strong> as they have <strong>some control</strong> over prices charged.
                    </li>

                    <li>In oligopoly, prices tend to be <strong>stable</strong> as businesses fear the loss of market
                        share/revenue which may result from a change in price. The kinked demand curve illustrates this
                        price stability.
                    </li>

                    <li>In monopolistic competition, businesses produce goods/services that are <strong>slightly
                        different</strong> (<strong>product differentiation</strong>) from those of their competitors.
                        This allows businesses to enjoy greater customer loyalty.
                    </li>
                </ul>
