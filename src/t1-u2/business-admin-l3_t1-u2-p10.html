                <img src="../images/t1/effective_feedback_03.jpg"
                     alt=""

                <p data-animate="4">Using self-awareness, it is possible to understand the impact of our own behaviour on others and take steps to adapt when necessary. As the psychotherapist Carl Jung said: 'There is no cure and no improving of the world that does not begin with the individual himself'.</p>

                <p data-animate="5">Self-awareness helps us to consciously think about how we influence and interact with others. If things are going well, reflection still helps because it enables us to see what we need to keep doing to maintain good working relationships. If there are problems, however, we need to reflect to see if any of our behaviours are causing issues.</p>

                <p data-animate="6">With the help of self-refection, and maybe a discussion with the line manager, we can:</p>

                <ul data-animate="7">
                    <li>identify how our behaviours impact others – in positive or negative ways</li>
                    <li>consider alternative ways of behaving – research other ways of behaving</li>
                    <li>try new approaches</li>
                    <li>collect feedback about effectiveness – with more reflection or discussion</li>
                    <li>implement further improvements</li>
                    <li>review regularly.</li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="8">If team members and colleagues are having problems, the causes may be nothing to do with their manager personally. However, the manager still needs to investigate causes so that they can approach team members in an appropriate manner, to see if they can help or support them with external problems.</p>
