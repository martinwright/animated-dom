                <h3 class="sub-heading"
                    data-animate="3">1 The concept of self-awareness</h3>

                <img src="../images/t1/effective_feedback_13.jpg"
                     alt=""
                     style="width:80%;"
                     data-animate="4"/>

                <p data-animate="5"><strong>Self-awareness</strong> is the <strong>conscious knowledge of ourselves</strong> – our character, desires, beliefs, qualities, motives and feelings. Having a good sense of these aspects of ourselves can help us in the workplace and in our private lives.</p>

                <p data-animate="6">We can assess our personal growth and understanding through self-awareness by, for example:</p>

                <ul data-animate="7">
                    <li>being aware of how people and things around us influence us</li>
                    <li>learning about how we can influence and interact with others.</li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="8">Developing self-awareness, and understanding our own psychology, is a skill that is part of our personal and professional development. Self-awareness can be applied in our working lives to help us to, for example:</p>

                <ul data-animate="9">
                    <li>understand emotions more clearly – ours and other people’s</li>
                    <li>improve our communication skills – to interact with others in the workplace and resolve conflict more effectively</li>
                    <li>improve leadership skills – and our general operational performance</li>
                    <li>improve job satisfaction – by focusing on job roles and tasks that truly motivate us</li>
                    <li>maximise career development opportunities.</li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="10">As we grow up, we base many of our actions, responses and attributes on things that we have learnt and been told along the way. For example, we might base our initial education and career choices on what our family members did. However, these choices might not suit our real desires, beliefs or character, and we need to develop self-awareness to discover more options.</p>

                <p data-animate="11">There are many tests and techniques available that help us to identify and understand ourselves in greater depth. They look at our character, qualities, motivation, feelings and so on, so that we can access information about ourselves that is often hidden or undiscovered.</p>

                <p data-animate="12">Techniques that can help us learn about how to reveal, recognise, evaluate and understand the different attributes and qualities that make us unique include, for example:</p>

                <ul data-animate="13">
                    <li>psychometric tests</li>
                    <li>management tools</li>
                    <li>coaching tools</li>
                    <li>self-reflection tools.</li>
                </ul>
