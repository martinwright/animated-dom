                <p data-animate="4">Self-reflection is often used as a management or coaching tool and the process focuses strongly on self-awareness â€“ eg keeping a journal, listening to the inner voice or practising mindfulness.</p>

                <p data-animate="5">Keeping a journal can be a useful tool. Going through the process of writing down our thoughts, experiences and feelings on a regular basis can help us to understand more about ourselves, especially when we review entries at a later date.</p>

                <p data-animate="6">Listening to our inner voice can reveal things that we may not have realised previously. Just writing down some of the thoughts as they pass through our mind can be revealing, then reviewing them once a week can add to our self-awareness.</p>

                <p data-animate="7">Practising mindfulness helps us to be aware of things going on in our mind, concentrate on the moment and allow unnecessary thoughts to pass through. There are many resources online, some of which are free, that help us to understand and train the mind, to improve concentration and aid stress management.</p>
