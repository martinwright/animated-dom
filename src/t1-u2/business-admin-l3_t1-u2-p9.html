                <h4 class="sub-heading"
                    data-animate="2">6 Potential impact of behaviour on others</h4>

                <p data-animate="4">All employees need to behave professionally at all times and not let personal beliefs or opinions interfere with their judgement and actions. They need to lead by example and be aware of the strengths, weaknesses and needs of people around them.</p>

                <p data-animate="5">In all activities, employees need to think about how their behaviour:</p>

                <ul data-animate="6">
                    <li>is perceived by others</li>
                    <li>impacts their own performance</li>
                    <li>affects working relationships.</li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="7">Any individual’s performance and behaviour can affect other people – there is a leadership element to every role – and those who are in or will potentially progress to a more senior management and/or leadership role are in a responsible and influential position. Leaders are nearly always a focus for attention, which makes sense as being visible and vocal are important elements of the role.</p>

                <p data-animate="8">However, people can judge leaders harshly and transfer their loyalty and support elsewhere very quickly. We only have to look at how often sports team managers and coaches are criticised or sacked to know how fragile a leader’s position can be.</p>

                <p data-animate="9">In the workplace it is essential for each individual to make sure that their behaviour and leadership skills are of the highest standard so that they can provide effective leadership through:</p>

                <ul data-animate="10">
                    <li>consistent use of good communication skills</li>
                    <li>helping their teams to meet organisational needs and objectives</li>
                    <li>offering effective and imaginative solutions to problems</li>
                    <li>bringing energy, enthusiasm and a clear focus</li>
                    <li>bringing a balanced and positive attitude to change. </li>
                </ul>

            </section>

            <section>

                <p data-animate="11">On a day-to-day level, examples of positive and inspirational leadership behaviour could include:</p>

                <ul data-animate="12">
                    <li><strong>using excellent communication skills</strong> able to engage and inspire team members and make them feel valued</li>
                    <li><strong>being fair and consistent</strong> when making decisions or solving problems</li>
                    <li><strong>good time-keeping and attendance</strong> to show commitment to and respect for the team and its objectives</li>
                    <li><strong>performing at consistently high levels</strong> leading the way to achieve deadlines, targets and quality standards</li>
                    <li><strong>displaying good conduct and behaviour</strong> that minimise discomfort, stress, resentment and embarrassment for other team members</li>
                    <li><strong>following good working practices</strong> that avoid unnecessary harm or injury, lost work time or disciplinary procedures. </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="13">An individual whose behaviour is positive, inspirational and professional will have the respect of team members, colleagues and other stakeholders. They will be able to deal with plans, strategy, decisions and problems with the positive support of those around them.</p>

                <p data-animate="14">On the other hand, an individual whose behaviour is negative for any length of time will soon lose the support of their team. They will find it impossible to inspire and lead their team if they do not have their respect and co-operation. For example, a manager who is always late, loses their temper, acts unfairly and inconsistently, will quickly come up against complaints from customers, colleagues and others, and find it very difficult to carry out their operational duties effectively.</p>

                <p data-animate="15">From time to time there will be unexpected circumstances that will adversely affect a good employee/manager’s behaviour, such as sudden illness or bereavement. When this happens, because they have a good and loyal working relationship, team members will usually join together to support them and help them through difficult times.</p>
