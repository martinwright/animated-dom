                     alt=""

                <p data-animate="4">There are tools that we use in coaching that help the development of self-awareness. One of these was designed in 1955 by American psychologists, Ingham and Luft, when they developed the Johari Window model. It was designed to use when working on self-awareness, personal development and understanding relationships.</p>

                <p data-animate="5">The idea is that we examine information about ourselves and enter it into the relevant ‘pane of the window’. The exercise of entering details can be revealing in itself, but we can work to change the sizes of the window panes as a focus for further analysis and personal development planning.</p>

                <p data-animate="6">A simple version of a Johari Window would be as follows:</p>

                <div class="table--fr1-fr1">
                    <div class="cell"><strong>1. Open/free area<br>
                        Known by the person<br>
                        Known by others<br>
                        Information about the person – eg skills, knowledge, experience, behaviour, attitude, feelings
                    </strong></div>
                    <div class="cell"><strong>2. Blind area<br>
                        Not known by the person<br>
                        Known by others<br>
                        Things that others know about the person that they do not know or realise themselves – eg issues that are deliberately withheld from the person
                    </strong></div>

                    <div class="cell"><strong>3. Hidden area<br>
                        Known by the person<br>
                        Not known by others<br>
                        Information that is withheld from others – eg feelings, fears, worries, manipulative intentions, secrets
                    </strong></div>
                    <div class="cell"><strong>4. Unknown area<br>
                        Not known to the person<br>
                        Not known by others<br>
                        Information that has not been recognised or revealed – eg a young person’s undiscovered talents and attributes that need to be revealed
                    </strong></div>

                </div>

                <p data-animate="7">The idea is to enlarge the open area by:</p>

                <ul data-animate="8">
                    <li>reducing the blind area – usually achieved through giving and receiving feedback</li>
                    <li>reducing the hidden area – through the process of disclosure.</li>
                </ul>
