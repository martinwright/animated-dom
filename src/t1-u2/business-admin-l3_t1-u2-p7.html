                <p data-animate="4">There are tools that we use in coaching that help the development of self-awareness.
                    One of these was designed in 1955 by American psychologists, Ingham and Luft, when they developed
                    the Johari Window model. It was designed to use when working on self-awareness, personal development
                    and understanding relationships.</p>

                <p data-animate="5">The idea is that we examine information about ourselves and enter it into the
                    relevant ‘pane of the window’. The exercise of entering details can be revealing in itself, but we
                    can work to change the sizes of the window panes as a focus for further analysis and personal
                    development planning.</p>
