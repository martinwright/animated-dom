                <p data-animate="4">Of course, in motivating others there are a number of other factors that we have to consider and, particularly, individual difference. Differences may arise on the basis of ethnicity, values and beliefs, and individual personality. For example, do we fully understand the personality traits of the people we work with and how do these affect motivation? It is important to recognise that individual and team behaviour, which is a combination of personality and learning, affects the decision-making process leaders and managers undertake when it comes to motivating colleagues.</p>

                <p data-animate="5">A lot is written about behaviour and, at the heart of motivation, sits the need of the organisation to manage individual behaviour for the good of both the team and the organisation as a whole. So what factors affect our behaviour? Let us consider the Behaviour Iceberg (below).</p>

                <p data-animate="7">While there may be other factors that affect our behaviour, for example the environment, the behaviour of most people stems from their personality (personal traits) and what they have learnt by observing others or by making mistakes. What we see above the waterline is the chosen behaviour of an individual. Below the waterline is the real personality and what we have learnt over a lifetime.</p>

                <p data-animate="8">To bring this to life, imagine that you are invited to a wedding and have to attend a funeral in the same week. You have one dark suit and a range of shirts or blouses. The relatives of the deceased have asked that mourners treat the funeral as a celebration and wear bright colours. You decide to wear a bright shirt and tie or colourful blouse to both the funeral and the wedding. Do you behave in the same way at both events? One imagines not! However, it is entirely possible that you could!</p>

                <p data-animate="9">The key point here is that you make a choice about your behaviour. And, of course, this happens all the time in the workplace, which can make it very difficult for a manager to assess a team memberâ€™s motivation. An apparent lack of enthusiasm for a particular task may not mean that the person charged with carrying it out is not motivated. It could be that they are, by nature, unenthusiastic in their demeanour. Alternatively, they might have other problems that they are worrying about.
