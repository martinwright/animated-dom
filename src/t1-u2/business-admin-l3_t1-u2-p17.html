                <p data-animate="4">Values and beliefs sit right at the root of what drives someone to operate and interact in the way they do. Virtually everything people do, including their contribution to discussion and rational discourse, is governed and regulated by their belief systems, their associated values and how they see themselves – their identity. Identity sits right at the core of what makes a person who they are. It incorporates all of their values, beliefs and accompanying characteristics, experience and perceptions.</p>

                <p data-animate="5"><strong>Beliefs</strong> are founded on our experience and help us make sense of the world. People pay attention to what they believe to be important and disregard things they consider to be unimportant. In this respect, beliefs act as filters. People's belief systems in the workplace are important to driving the success of the business, as it is beliefs that drive our individual behaviour.</p>

                <p data-animate="6"><strong>Values</strong> are essentially standards and conditions that relate to what you consider important and necessary for you to be content and satisfied. It is important and highly productive to have goals that are congruent with individuals’ values – ie consistent with what is important to them, which will in turn lead to conviction and leaps in levels of achievement.</p>

                <p data-animate="7"><strong>Attitudes</strong> are personal views – an opinion or general feeling about something. Attitudes of individuals at work can, for example, be positive or negative, helpful or unhelpful. Needless to say, an individual’s attitude will affect their contribution and involvement in dialogue and rational discourse.</p>

                <p data-animate="8"><strong>Emotions</strong> are strong feelings about somebody or something. The main difference between feelings and emotions is that feelings are induced by an external factor whereas emotions can be entirely internalised. Many of the decisions and contributions to dialogue we make are made because of how we feel or how we expect to feel. Emotions can stunt or disrupt clear thinking.</p>

                <p data-animate="9"><strong>Ethics</strong> are moral principles that guide the way individuals behave.</p>
