                     alt=""
                     style="width:100%;"
                     data-animate="6"/>

                <p>The online business dictionary defines continuous improvement as follows:</p>

                <p>‘Programmed, and then almost unbroken, flow of improvements realised under a scheme such as Kaizen
                    [or] lean production …’ </p>

                <p>The ISO, in the 2012 guide to quality management principles, describe continuous improvement as:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Employing a consistent organisation-wide approach to continual improvement of the organisation’s
                        performance.
                    </li>

                    <li>Providing people with training in the methods and tools of continual improvement.
                    </li>

                    <li>Making continual improvement of products, processes and systems an objective for every
                        individual in the organisation.
                    </li>

                    <li>Establishing goals to guide, and measures to track, continual improvement.
                    </li>

                    <li>Recognising and acknowledging improvements.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The key difference between continuous improvement and typical step change that occurs in
                    organisations is the level of risk the change generates.</p>

                <p>Step change or business process re-engineering involves making improvements by undertaking
                    significant changes. Changes to entire processes or systems not only cost more but also naturally
                    carry a higher level of risk.</p>

                <p>Continuous improvement is a continual flow of very small changes and improvements that can be
                    implemented by the person who comes up with the suggestion. Continuous improvement harnesses the
                    power of many small but ongoing and highly regular changes that add up over time.</p>

                <p>Small incremental changes will carry lower levels of risk from disruption and will cost less. In
                    addition, small incremental changes meet with less resistance from people and are more easily
                    incorporated into existing systems. </p>

                <p>There are a number of techniques and approaches that appear under the umbrella of continuous improvement such as:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>root cause analysis (RCA)
                    </li>

                    <li>total quality management (TQM)
                    </li>

                    <li>six sigma
                    </li>

                    <li>Crosby’s 14 Steps
                    </li>

                    <li>lean production (also known as lean manufacturing or just ‘lean’)
                    </li>

                    <li>kaizen.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Over the next few pages we are going to focus on lean production, kaizen and root cause analysis.</p>
