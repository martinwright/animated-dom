                     data-animate="6"/>

                <p>This is a technique that finds possible solutions by identifying the root causes of problems. It is
                    also referred to as <strong>cause and effect analysis</strong> and makes use of <strong>fishbone
                        diagrams</strong>, <strong>herringbone diagrams</strong> and <strong>Ishikawa diagrams</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>The technique can be used to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>discover the root cause of problems, especially for complicated problems
                    </li>

                    <li>reveal ‘bottlenecks’ in a process that causes delays
                    </li>

                    <li>identify where and why a process does not work
                    </li>

                    <li>improve quality control.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>There are four steps to using this technique:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Step 1</strong><br>identify the problem – eg what the problem is, who is involved, where
                        and when it occurs.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Step 2</strong><br>work out the major factors involved – eg systems or methods,
                        equipment/machinery, materials, management issues, people or environment.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Step 3</strong><br>identify possible causes of the problem – eg brainstorm the different
                        factors in step 2 and add them to the diagram.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Step 4</strong><br>analyse the diagram – eg look at all the possible causes and identify
                        problem areas that have a knock-on effect on other issues – work to identify the <strong>root
                            causes</strong>.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>An example fishbone diagram:</p>

                <img src="../images/t7-u2/fishbone_diagram_PIVOT.png"
                     alt=""
                     style="width:100%;"
                     data-animate="6"/>

                <p>In this example, we can see that:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>traffic problems caused delays
                    </li>

                    <li>volunteers worked from notes and maps given out at their 9am briefing
                    </li>

                    <li>the manager was informed about the change of venue at 10am via email.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>As in our example above, the ‘bones’ can be labelled with any factor relevant to the problem. However
                    the typical factors used when working through a fishbone diagram would be:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Materials</strong><br>is the problem caused by any of the materials used, eg defective,
                        delivered late, wrong type?
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Machinery</strong><br>is the problem caused by machinery issues, eg
                        unreliable/broken/out of date?
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Methods</strong><br>is the problem caused by working methods, eg out of date processes?
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Management issues</strong><br>is the problem caused by, eg budget restrictions,
                        headcount limits?
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>People</strong><br>is the problem being caused by staff, eg those new to the role, or
                        who need more training or support?
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Environment</strong><br>is the problem being caused by the physical environment, eg too
                        hot or cold, heating/lighting, space or location?
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Once the problem has been clearly defined and the nature, scope and impact is understood, we can then
                    work through these factors to identify the root cause, or in more complex problems, causes.</p>

                <p>There can also be links between the different factors and causes. For example, there may be a process
                    that is out of date and is contributing to the problem. Another cause might be that people are not
                    working effectively because they are following an out of date process. This may mean a solution that
                    both updates the process and trains the relevant people to use the new process.</p>

                <p>Where there are a number of issues, it may be because there is more than one definable problem. For
                    example, customers might be calling to complain about a defective product, however the customer
                    relationship management (CRM) system keeps crashing which is resulting in further complaints.
                    Following an investigation it may be found that there is a specific problem with a product which is
                    causing the customer complaints in the first place. However, it may also be that there is a problem
                    with the CRM system. In this case there are two definable problems – firstly with the defective
                    product and secondly with the CRM system.</p>
