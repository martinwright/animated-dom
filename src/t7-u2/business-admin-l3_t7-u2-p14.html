                <p><strong>Just in time (JIT)</strong> – simply means supplying what you need only at the time you need
                    it and not before. Therefore materials and inventories are only used and manufactured as a result of
                    customer demand – this is also referred to as ‘pull’. Further, in response to this demand, materials
                    and inventories are only supplied at the point in time and in the quantity they are needed in the
                    process.</p>

                <p>A manufacturing example would be the delivery of the doors of a car that is being built on a
                    production line. The doors for the vehicle are supplied to the line only when the car reaches that
                    part of the process and not before. This requires careful scheduling of manufacture and automation
                    but means the line keeps moving without delays.</p>

                <p>This also means that inventory and materials will be supplied in sufficient batches for the process.
                    Therefore the speed at which components are made is carefully managed so that only the required
                    amount is supplied. </p>

                <p>In order to integrate JIT principles:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Create standardised approaches to work</strong><br> eliminating any variations of
                        processes and procedures will reduce the chance of defects arising because all workers are doing
                        a piece of work in the same way.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Use customer demand or ‘pull’ to schedule work</strong><br>avoid work that does not add
                        value to the direct needs of the customer.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Zero defects</strong> – this aspect of lean can empower employees to stop production in the
                    event of any defect being detected. Any sub-standard material, process or product is deemed
                    unacceptable.</p>

                <p>This means getting the work right first time – every time. Errors and defects will, of course, occur,
                    however creating a culture that continuously strives to reduce and eliminate defects increases
                    quality throughout.</p>
