                <h4 data-animate="2">10 Kaizen</h4>

                <p>Translated the word 'kai' means 'change' or ‘change over time’ and 'zen' means ‘good’ or 'to make
                    better'. However kaizen tends to be more commonly referred to as <strong>continuous
                        improvement</strong>.

                <p>Masaaki Imai pioneered kaizen in 1980's Japan as a way of improving business processes and quality.
                    Here kaizen is being applied to operational management and specifically improving quality and
                    reducing waste.</p>

                <p>Incorporating many of the best tools and techniques related to the growth and development of
                    manufacturing in Japan in the 1980s (JIT/PDCA/fishbone etc), kaizen epitomises continuous,
                    incremental and orderly small changes that create a momentum of quality and business improvements in
                    every part of an organisation.</p>

                <p>Japanese companies in the 1980s became so good at this that they have changed the world of
                    manufacturing. So much so that most large manufacturers around the world now adopt kaizen (and lean)
                    as normal working practices.</p>

                <p>Like lean, kaizen focuses on reducing and removing waste wherever possible and the seven forms of
                    waste discussed earlier are relevant to kaizen. Just as important, however, is the need to keep and
                    maintain a tidy workspace. Kaizen’s 5S housekeeping approach provides a valuable framework for ‘good
                    housekeeping’ to create the right conditions for kaizen to flourish. The 5Ss are:</p>

                <div class="table--t7-u2-14">
                    <div class="cell"><h3>1. Seiri – tidiness</h3></div>
                    <div class="cell">Sort what is needed for the work from what is not needed and remove the latter. If
                        it is needed constantly for the work then it stays
                    </div>

                    <div class="cell"><h3>2. Seiton – order</h3></div>
                    <div class="cell">A place for everything and everything in its place. This step ensures everyone
                        knows where they can find what they need, when they need it. It also considers how processes
                        flow and whether they are as efficient as possible
                    </div>

                    <div class="cell"><h3>3. Seiso – cleanliness</h3></div>
                    <div class="cell">Keeping all workspaces clean and shiny. Everyone should be part of ensuring this
                        happens. Workspaces should be neatly kept and orderly
                    </div>

                    <div class="cell"><h3>4. Seiketsu – standardise</h3></div>
                    <div class="cell">Once there is proper tidiness, order and cleanliness, this S seeks to standardise
                        and make the first three normal practice. Once a workspace is ‘set’ it should be maintained that
                        way by all. This can be further embedded through photographs of correctly laid out workspaces,
                        so everyone knows what they should look like
                    </div>

                    <div class="cell"><h3>5. Shitsuke – discipline</h3></div>
                    <div class="cell">This is about sustaining the 5Ss and embedding them and kaizen deep into the
                        culture of the workforce and the organisation. It is leading by example so that everyone
                        develops a ‘kaizen mind’ while working to uphold kaizen and levels of housekeeping and create a
                        continuously improving culture
                    </div>
                </div>


                <p>The first three Ss are workforce led and are the practical application of the principles ensuring the
                    removal of waste, establishing order and maintaining clean work spaces. They are also highly visible
                    and observers can see whether areas are tidy, orderly and clean.</p>

                <p>The last two Ss are about effective management and leadership ensuring that everyone applies what has
                    been agreed consistently. They also work to embed the approach into the culture or ‘the way things
                    are done’.</p>
