                <p>In his 1990 book, <em>The Machine That Changed the World</em>, James Womack explains how Toyota’s approach to
                    production proved to be a more efficient and successful system than the traditional mass production
                    approaches in use in the west at that time. This approach to production of cars (known as the Toyota
                    Production System) became what is now known as ‘lean’.</p>

                <p>The online dictionary defines lean manufacturing as follows:</p>

                <p>'Doing more with less by employing "lean thinking". Lean manufacturing involves never ending efforts
                    to eliminate or reduce "muda" (Japanese for waste or any activity that consumes resources without
                    adding value) in design, manufacturing, distribution, and customer service processes …'</p>

                <p>It has also been described as: <strong>‘… doing more with less …’</strong> Anderson et al (2013).</p>

                <p>Lean production seeks to eliminate waste from the system of manufacturing without compromising
                    quality. This also means providing increased value to the customer by providing a product they want,
                    manufactured without unnecessary waste. A reduced level of waste speeds up production and keeps
                    costs, and therefore the price to the customer, down.</p>

                <p>Although initially adopted by manufacturing, there are some key principles in lean that are valuable
                    in all work settings. No organisation wants to incur waste where it does not need to. The basic lean
                    principles we are going to look at are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>seven forms of waste
                    </li>

                    <li>just in time
                    </li>

                    <li>zero defects.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Seven forms of waste (muda)</strong> – in lean, waste is broadly split into two categories:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>waste that is not necessary and does not add any value
                    </li>

                    <li>waste that does not add value but cannot be eliminated for some reason.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>In the first category, where waste is both unnecessary and does not add any value to either the
                    organisation or the customer, then lean would suggest these are the first and most pressing targets
                    for removal.</p>

                <p>The second category of waste is one that does not provide any value but cannot be removed. An example
                    would be where, for legal or regulatory reasons, hard copies of documents have to be printed for
                    audit or inspection. It is a waste to print a document held electronically but the inspection regime
                    requires hard copies.</p>

                <p>Lean’s seven forms of waste help managers to focus on the different parts of any operation to
                    identify and potentially remove any unnecessary waste. The seven forms are as follows:</p>

                        move anything if it is necessary and is part of the process
                    </div>
                    <div class="cell"><ul>

                    <div class="cell">Waiting or delays for anything necessary to the process is waste. This might be

                    <div class="cell">Making more than is needed and before being needed is waste – this will also cause
                        other wastes such as inventory and transportation
                    </div>
                    <div class="cell"><ul>
