                <p data-animate=“*”>Policies and procedures are determined by the organisation, taking a lead from legislation and
                    employment law. They are written to ensure that an organisation's values are carried out in specific
                    ways and to meet the various regulations and legislation specific to their business activities.</p>

                <p data-animate=“*”>A simple way to understand the difference between policies and procedures is to think about them this
                    way: policies guide decision making and procedures drive action.</p>

                <p data-animate=“*”>Policies are guidelines that regulate ‘the way things are done’ in an organisation. They set out
                    expectations regarding how certain matters will be dealt with and set out parameters, such as:
                    expected standards, behaviours and the organisational stance on particular issues.</p>

                <p data-animate=“*”>Some typical business policies include:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li>code of conduct</li>

                    <li>anti-discrimination and harassment policy
                    </li>

                    <li>clear desk policy
                    </li>

                    <li>recruitment policy
                    </li>

                    <li>internet and email policy
                    </li>

                    <li>mobile phone policy
                    </li>

                    <li>drug and alcohol policy
                    </li>

                    <li>disciplinary policy
                    </li>

                    <li>customer service policy
                    </li>

                    <li>display screen equipment policy
                    </li>

                    <li>fire safety policy
                    </li>

                    <li>first aid policy.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate=“*”>Policies tend to reflect the bigger issues faced by organisations whilst procedures provide a
                    framework for dealing with day-to-day matters in an organised and consistent way. Procedures set out
                    the way that policies will be implemented.</p>

                <p data-animate=“*”>Policies often give rise to step-by-step procedures that must be followed in order to carry out
                    certain tasks. Procedures ensure a specific job or task is completed in a set way, guaranteeing the
                    same outcome. It is good practice to have formalised and documented organisational procedures
                    because they: </p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li>provide greater clarity of roles and requirements for staff
                    </li>

                    <li>provide quality assurance and improved organisation
                    </li>

                    <li>ensure consistency across the organisation including in standards of customer service
                    </li>

                    <li>ensure legislative requirements are met
                    </li>

                    <li>can be used in staff training.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate=“*”>In combination, policies and procedures should:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li>make clear the organisation’s position on important issues
                    </li>

                    <li>define what is expected from employees and the consequences of any breaches of the stated expectations
                    </li>

                    <li>be consistent.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate=“*”>Policies and procedures provide a framework for workers at all levels to adhere to – ensuring that
                    expectations are clearly set out and workers are treated fairly. You will usually receive a handbook
                    or manual from your employer – or the organisation's policies and procedures will be set out online
                    or available via your human resources department.</p>

                <p data-animate=“*”>Read your organisation's policies and procedures and discuss them with your manager and colleagues –
                    are there any policies you are surprised by? Any that you disagree with? Are there any that you need
                    to learn more about?</p>
