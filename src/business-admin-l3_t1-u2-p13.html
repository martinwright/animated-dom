                <p data-animate="4">There are two types of motivation: extrinsic and intrinsic.</p>

                <p data-animate="5"><strong>Extrinsic motivation</strong> is where an individual is encouraged to reach a goal or target by reward or sanction. For example, a young person sitting an examination may be motivated to pass an examination because a parent offers a financial reward for success.</p>

                <p data-animate="6"><strong>Intrinsic motivation</strong> is the motivation to succeed in something or to pursue something purely because it is interesting, that comes from within. Pursuit of a hobby is a good example of intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is difficult to stimulate in the workplace.</p>

                <p data-animate="7">Management experts have studied motivation in depth for many years and have concluded that there are two main theories of motivation: namely, ‘content’ and ‘process’. Content theories focus on ‘what’ motivates people, attributing motivation to the satisfaction of individual needs and goals, while process theories concentrate on ‘how’ people are motivated. Process theories explore how satisfaction of an individual’s needs affect their behaviour.</p>
