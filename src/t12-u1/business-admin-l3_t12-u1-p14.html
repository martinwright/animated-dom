                <p>The most important tasks for the chairperson are to guide meetings and keep them running to time.
                    People attending meetings become irritated, uncomfortable and resentful if meetings are not run
                    well. For example, nobody appreciates spending their time in a meeting that:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>goes on too long
                    </li>

                    <li>does not have clear objectives
                    </li>

                    <li>does not cover all of the items on the agenda
                    </li>

                    <li>does not stick to the agenda – except for time allocated to ‘any other business’
                    </li>

                    <li>does not allow people to speak and get important points across
                    </li>

                    <li>feels boring and irrelevant
                    </li>

                    <li>wastes time by letting some people speak for too long, or in too much detail
                    </li>

                    <li>gets out of hand with too many interruptions, inappropriate language or emotional outbursts
                    </li>

                    <li>is not clear about decisions, changes, future actions or new responsibilities.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>The chairperson needs to plan well, be focused on the objectives and be aware of people’s
                    expectations. They need to take command every so often to keep the meeting on track and make sure
                    that time is spent effectively. For example, the chairperson needs to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>make sure that the right people are invited to attend</strong><br>eg to present and
                        share information and take part in making decisions
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>switch</strong><br>mobil
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>make sure that everyone has access to the information they need</strong><br>eg to be
                        able to prepare, share information and take away material that needs to be studied later
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>make sure that everyone is clear about the objectives of the meeting</strong><br>eg to
                        keep everyone focused and engaged; to manage expectations
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>use good listening and questioning techniques</strong><br>eg to encourage people to
                        contribute effectively and share information fully
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>guide the speakers</strong><br>eg to introduce themselves, make their points and stick
                        to the agenda
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>summarise decisions and future actions</strong><br>eg to set the date and objectives of
                        the next meeting; to clarify what has been agreed and what follow-up actions are required.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>Controlling the meeting can be quite difficult as there needs to be a balance between getting enough
                    information from people without getting too much. The amount of time given to each item on the
                    agenda will depend on its complexity and the information that people need to discuss. If an item is
                    taking too long, for example, the chairperson can announce that they will allow five more minutes of
                    discussion, bring the matter to a close, move on to the next item and arrange for the matter to be
                    discussed again in another meeting, if necessary.</p>
