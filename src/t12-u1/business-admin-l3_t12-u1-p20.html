                <p>An AGM is a ‘gathering of the directors and stockholders (shareholders) of every incorporated firm,
                    required by law to be held each calendar year. Generally, not more than 15 months can elapse between
                    two AGMs, and a 21-days' written notice of its date is required to be given to the stockholders. The
                    main purpose of an AGM is to comply with legal requirements, such as the presentation and approval
                    of the audited accounts, election of directors, and appointment of auditors for the new accounting
                    term. Other items that may also be discussed include compensation of officers, confirmation of
                    proposed dividend and issues raised by the stockholders’. –
