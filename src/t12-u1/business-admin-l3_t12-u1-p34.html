                <h4 data-animate="2">8 Event organisation</h4>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Venue/location</h5>

                <div class="p-60">

                <p data-animate=“*”>The venue might be better suited in-house depending on rooms available, the size and delegates
                    invited. However, if a national event is being organised then location will be extremely important
                    to ensure all can attend.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Security management</h5>

                <p data-animate=“*”>Regardless of the size of the event or the amount of people in attendance, you must always provide
                    security. Security covers a broad spectrum of tasks for example:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li>checking registered delegates into the venue
                    </li>

                    <li>checking staff and contractors into the venue
                    </li>

                    <li>managing parking areas
                    </li>

                    <li>managing the safe movement of people
                    </li>

                    <li>providing security measures to counter any potential threats to event security
                    </li>

                    <li>providing emergency response
                    </li>

                    <li>managing safe evacuation
                    </li>

                    <li>liaison with emergency services before, during and after the event.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate=“*”>These duties are usually covered by the venue's permanent staff, however you may need to consult
                    security professionals for further advice and guidance.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Publicity/advertising</h5>

                <p data-animate=“*”>When advertising and publicising an event, it is important to think about the type of audience you
                    want to hear about it and ultimately attend. The event needs to be advertised to ensure good
                    attendance. This may be by a targeted mailshot, flyers, social media, leaflets and advertisements in
                    relevant media.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Equipment and resources</h5>

                <p data-animate=“*”>Ensuring equipment and resources are organised and available during the event is important. Resources
                    and equipment can be projectors, computers, flip charts, audio-visual equipment, whiteboards,
                    printers/copiers, desks, chairs, stands, decorations and stationery.</p>

                <p data-animate=“*”>It may be necessary to hire equipment for the event, so this will need to be organised in advance.
                    Cost and budget must be discussed and agreed beforehand to avoid overspending.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Documentation</h5>

                <p data-animate=“*”>Training manuals, worksheets and reading material may be required for delegates to refer to during or
                    after the event.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Subject expert</h5>

                <p data-animate=“*”>These are usually required for a conference or seminar. It is important the expert/speaker is briefed
                    beforehand and is clear what needs to be communicated.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Caterers</h5>

                <p data-animate=“*”>Caterers might be required to provide refreshments for the delegates. This could be food, drinks or
                    snacks. Outside caterers might be required or it may be something that can be arranged in-house. It
                    is important to agree this and organise accordingly.</p>
