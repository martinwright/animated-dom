                <p>After meetings, the chairperson’s managerial input continues. They need to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>communicate recorded actions
                    </li>

                    <li>take follow-up action, when required
                    </li>

                    <li>make sure other people complete follow-up actions.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Communicating recorded actions</h5>

                <p>The chairperson needs to make sure that information has been circulated after meetings. This is important for:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>people who attended the meeting</strong><br>eg so that they can go ahead and action the
                        points that are their responsibility, as shown in the minutes
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>people who did not attend the meeting</strong><br>eg so that they can see what was
                        agreed and what they have to follow up
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>compliance</strong><br>eg as part of a legal process where people need to be informed of
                        decisions and agreed actions.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Documents could include minutes and any other relevant key documents and can be sent in the
                    paper-based or electronic format set out in the organisation’s procedures. If it is critical to know
                    that people have received minutes and documents, there may be procedures where the recipient needs
                    to acknowledge receipt.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Taking follow-up action</h5>

                <p>As a leader, the chairperson needs to make sure that they follow up decisions and actions that affect
                    them. For example, if the chairperson has agreed to research something and report their findings
                    within a week of the meeting, they need to make sure that they do this on time, or report why they
                    are late if there is a problem. They need to lead by example to maintain credibility and other
                    people’s trust and confidence.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Making sure other people take follow-up action</h5>

                <p>The chairperson needs to manage other people to make sure that they follow up on decisions and agreed
                    actions. If they have delegated responsibility for follow-up actions, the chairperson needs to keep
                    an eye on progress, and help to provide support and resources if there are problems.</p>

                <p>The <strong>minutes</strong> are a useful guide as to who needs to take action, the details of what
                    they should do and the timescale they need to follow. The chairperson, other managers, leaders or
                    decision-makers can use them as a tool when planning and monitoring progress.</p>

                <p>The <strong>agenda</strong> of the next meeting is another useful tool to encourage people to
                    complete agreed actions. It usually includes a reference to the actions agreed in the previous
                    meeting and this provides a focus to make sure that follow-up actions are not overlooked.</p>
