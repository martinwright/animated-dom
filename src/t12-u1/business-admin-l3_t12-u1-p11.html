                <p>Leaders inspire and motivate people – they focus on people and set new directions for a group to
                    follow. When chairing a meeting, the leadership skills used can include, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>personal and interpersonal skills to get the most out of the people at the meeting
                    </li>

                    <li>analysing results and trends, forecasting, innovating and giving direction for change
                    </li>

                    <li>communicating visions and plans
                    </li>

                    <li>encouraging, praising, developing and inspiring team members.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The chairperson’s leadership style can be important. For example, using Kurt Lewin’s theory of
                    leadership styles, the chairperson may employ one or all of the following styles:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>autocratic – expecting others to do things their way only
                    </li>

                    <li>democratic – allowing other people to be involved in the decision-making process
                    </li>

                    <li>laissez-faire – trusting their team’s capabilities, willing to stand back and let the team get
                        on with the tasks.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>A mixture of all three styles will often be needed when chairing a meeting. Strong, autocratic
                    leadership can be used to keep things on time and to make sure that the points on the agenda are
                    covered. The democratic style can help to involve and engage other people, gaining their trust and
                    commitment and making the most of what they have to offer. The laissez-faire style is important when
                    delegating tasks and can feature when the chairperson knows that they can trust people to take
                    ownership of tasks and follow-up actions.</p>
