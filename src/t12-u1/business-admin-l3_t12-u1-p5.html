                <p data-animate=“*”>When organising a meeting, the person leading it will often generate and circulate <strong>an
                    agenda</strong> in advance. This is a list of points that they are expecting to cover, in order,
                    within the time allocated to the meeting.</p>

                <p data-animate=“*”>The agenda is based on the organisational objectives that the people attending need to discuss, for
                    example:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li>data to measure and evaluate progress so far in achieving objectives
                    </li>

                    <li>issues and problems
                    </li>

                    <li>possible solutions
                    </li>

                    <li>forecasts, plans and targets about how to achieve the next set of objectives.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate=“*”>For example, a quarterly meeting between department managers and team leaders to review activities
                    could result in these items being on the agenda:</p>

                <ol data-animate=“*”>
                    <li>Welcome and introduction – from the senior manager holding the meeting.
                    </li>

                    <li>Minutes from the last meeting – to be agreed and signed off as being accurate.
                    </li>

                    <li>Apologies – from people who cannot attend the meeting.
                    </li>

                    <li>Production output for the last two quarters – to compare and analyse.
                    </li>

                    <li>Problems arising – eg delays, staffing issues or problems with suppliers.
                    </li>

                    <li>Forecasts and targets for the next quarter.
                    </li>

                    <li>Anticipated resources needed and potential problems.
                    </li>

                    <li>Review draft targets for the following year.
                    </li>

                    <li>Recruitment plans for the following year.
                    </li>

                    <li>Training courses planned for the following year.
                    </li>

                    <li>Any other business (AOB) – for people to add things that need to be discussed.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p data-animate=“*”>It can be useful to put the expected time next to each item, so that people can see how long has been
                    allocated. Also, it is helpful to show who will be leading each item. This helps to focus attention
                    and identify speakers that may not be known to all of the attendees. For example, items one, two,
                    three and 11 would be led by the chairperson, but items seven and eight about forecasts and targets
                    would be led by the sales director.</p>

                <p data-animate=“*”>It is important to have a meeting agenda that addresses the objectives of the organisation so that, for example:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li><strong>the meeting is focused, structured and has direction</strong> &ndash; to keep things moving
                        as people can see how much business needs to be covered, and in what order; to avoid people
                        spending valuable time talking about issues that are nothing to do with the objectives; to keep
                        the meeting on time
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>people can see what needs to be prepared before the meeting</strong> &ndash; eg reports and
                        figures that are going to be discussed
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>participants can anticipate questions they may want to ask</strong> &ndash; eg by having
                        advance warning that they will discuss specific problems with other managers.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate=“*”>Having an agenda shows that the meeting is serious and will be run well. Everyone’s time is precious
                    and it is important to use the time wisely and efficiently, making the most of the opportunity to
                    share information, review objectives and agree the ways forward.</p>
