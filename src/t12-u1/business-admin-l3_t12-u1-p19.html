                <h5 data-animate="2">Conferences and seminars</h5>

                <p>Conferences and seminars are meetings put on to discuss a specific topic. Seminars are often
                    recurrent and include the participation of the delegates.</p>

                <p>The features of conferences and seminars are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>educational/informative
                    </li>

                    <li>may have specialist speakers
                    </li>

                    <li>presentations
                    </li>

                    <li>delegates are invited or register to attend
                    </li>

                    <li>they may run over one or several sessions.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Promotional events</h5>

                <p>These are based on selling something or increasing business awareness, such as trade fairs, book
                    signings and fashion shows.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Exhibitions/trade shows</h5>

                <p>These provide an organisation or individual with an opportunity to show off their products or work.
                    An organisation may pay a fee for a stand or stall at a trade fair. The size of the pitch required
                    needs to be considered, as well as the staffing of it.</p>

                <p>Delegates are likely to be moving around looking at what attracts their attention rather than sitting
                    around a table.</p>

                <p>Demonstrations of a new product, samples and promotional 'freebies', such as pens bearing the
                    organisation name, will act as a reminder after the event.</p>

                <p>Trade shows and exhibitions are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>used to showcase products and services that companies offer
                    </li>

                    <li>usually not open to the general public
                    </li>

                    <li>generally held in large exhibition centres
                    </li>

                    <li>large events.
                    </li>
                </ul>
