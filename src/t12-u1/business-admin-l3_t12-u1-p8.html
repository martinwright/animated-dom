                <p>Some key documents need to be made available before the meeting so that people can be fully prepared, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>the agenda
                    </li>

                    <li>briefing notes
                    </li>

                    <li>reports and materials for people who have been involved with their preparation – eg so that they
                        can get to know their material before they present their part of the report during the meeting.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Many key documents only need to be made available <strong>during</strong> the meeting to support the
                    information being discussed. These could include, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>copies of the agenda for people who have not seen it
                    </li>

                    <li>reports
                    </li>

                    <li>handouts, workbooks and other training materials
                    </li>

                    <li>contracts
                    </li>

                    <li>samples of marketing materials.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                </section>

                <p>All of the key documents can also be circulated to appropriate people after the meeting. If people
                    have not attended the meeting, they may need to be informed about all of the points, decisions and
                    information that were discussed so that they can comment and stay up to date. If people did attend
                    the meeting, they may need additional documents after the meeting that confirm what was agreed and
                    what follow-up actions are needed. These could include, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>minutes – draft or agreed
                    </li>

                    <li>forms – that need to be completed
                    </li>

                    <li>further reports – to show progress and update follow-up actions.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>When circulating key documentation, it is important to make sure that it is appropriate to share it.
                    For example, care needs to be taken to make sure that:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>the recipient is authorised to receive it
                    </li>

                    <li>the information is relevant to them
                    </li>

                    <li>confidentiality is not breached
                    </li>

                    <li>the information is current and correct
                    </li>

                    <li>the documents are sent out at the right time
                    </li>

                    <li>the information is sent in a suitable format – eg secure email or by post.
                    </li>
                </ul>
