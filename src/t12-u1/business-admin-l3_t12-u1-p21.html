                <p>These events can be used to train both internal and external customers on a set of learning
                    objectives. They:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>can be held in-house or at external venues
                    </li>

                    <li>can be over one or a multiple of days.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>What type of resources will the trainer have had to prepare for the event?</p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Team-building events</h5>

                <p>There is a wide range of events used to develop teams. These events are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>used to create more effective working environments for employees
                    </li>

                    <li>generally held away from the workplace
                    </li>

                    <li>held in an informal environment
                    </li>

                    <li>can involve both indoor and outdoor activities.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Why might businesses use a team-building event? Search the internet and research the wide range of
                    team-building events on offer.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Awards ceremonies</h5>

                <p>These are used to celebrate success or achievement; examples include celebrating the success of
                    learners (eg a college or university), industry awards (eg the Oscars), or recognition of bravery
                    (eg the Pride of Britain awards). Awards ceremonies:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>are delivered in a formal environment
                    </li>

                    <li>can also incorporate other events, such as dinners and after-show activities.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Think about any events that you have attended within school, college or the workplace. What type of
                    things would the event organiser have had to think about? </p>
