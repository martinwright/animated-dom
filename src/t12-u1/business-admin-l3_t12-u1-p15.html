                <p>This can be the hardest task for the chairperson and they need to make sure that the meeting is
                    balanced and that everyone gets a chance to contribute.</p>

                <p>To keep the meeting in balance, the chairperson needs to be ready to take command and not be afraid
                    to chair the meeting. The following table gives some examples of problems that may occur, along with
                    some suggested solutions:</p>

                    <div class="cell">New or shy people do not contribute to the meeting</div>
                    <div class="cell">Invite new people to introduce themselves<br>
                        Ask questions – their silence may not mean that they agree with what others are saying
                    </div>

                    <div class="cell">People from minority groups or who have unpopular views are not heard</div>
                    <div class="cell">Make sure that they are invited to air their views<br>
                        Insist that others give them time to speak, even if they disagree<br>
                        Ask if anyone who has not spoken yet wishes to comment
                    </div>

                    <div class="cell">People interrupt each other</div>
                    <div class="cell">Be firm and consistent<br>
                        Acknowledge the interruption but avoid being drawn in<br>
                        Ask the person who is interrupting to wait until the first person has finished, then go back to
                        them to air their points of view
                    </div>

                    <div class="cell">People talk amongst themselves</div>
                    <div class="cell">Stop the chatter politely at first, then firmly – it is distracting and
                        discourteous<br>
                        Be firm about them waiting for their turn to speak<br>
                        Emphasise the importance of listening to what the speaker has to say
                    </div>

                    <div class="cell">Speakers talk for too long or get sidetracked away from the topic</div>
                    <div class="cell">Again, be firm and consistent<br>
                        Thank them for their contributions and for raising interesting points, then explain you want to
                        ask others to comment
                    </div>

                    <div class="cell">People criticise decisions or each other in a negative way</div>

                        Ask for suggestions about how things could be improved<br>
                        Ask the critic what they would do to resolve the issue

                        Summarise the issues and suggest ways forward<br>
                        Take the focus away from individuals and concentrate on the broader issues
