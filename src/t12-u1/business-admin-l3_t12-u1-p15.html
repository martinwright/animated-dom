                <p>This can be the hardest task for the chairperson and they need to make sure that the meeting is
                    balanced and that everyone gets a chance to contribute.</p>

                <p>To keep the meeting in balance, the chairperson needs to be ready to take command and not be afraid
                    to chair the meeting. The following table gives some examples of problems that may occur, along with
                    some suggested solutions:</p>
