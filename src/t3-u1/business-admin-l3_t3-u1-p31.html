                <img src="../images/t3-u1/different_forms-of_communication_01_b.jpg"
                     alt=""

                     data-animate="3"/>

                <p data-animate="4">A huge number of messages are sent non-verbally. These can be transmitted through, for example:</p>

                <ul data-animate="5">
                    <li>posture and body language</li>
                    <li>gestures and touching</li>
                    <li>physical appearance.</li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="4">How people stand, how close they are ‘in someone’s space’, eye contact, fidgeting and hand movements all add to the verbal messages.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">A person who frowns, looks at the floor and sits with their arms folded gives off very negative messages. A person who sits or stands upright, and who smiles and uses good eye contact, is far more approachable and less threatening.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">Examples of good and useful <strong>body language</strong> include:</p>

                <ul data-animate="5">
                    <li>having an open and relaxed posture</li>
                    <li>facing the person but not standing too close – about an arm’s length away is comfortable for most people</li>
                    <li>smiling when appropriate – although it is important to be friendly, we need to show that comments are taken seriously</li>
                    <li>using facial expressions to show sympathy or reassurance</li>
                    <li>using eye contact – although we need to be aware that some people (and cultures) find too much eye contact inappropriate and threatening</li>
                    <li>being sensitive to the person’s own body language</li>
                    <li>being flexible about our own body language and gestures so that we do not appear threatening or unapproachable.</li>
                </ul>

                </figure>

                <p data-animate="4">All gestures and body language support what we are saying and how we are listening. If we say positive things but use negative body language, people will not believe or trust us. They will think that the good things we are saying are untrue.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">Conversely, if our verbal and non-verbal messages are compatible, our messages are far more convincing and acceptable. Someone who speaks enthusiastically, uses their hands expressively, moves around a stage and stands up straight will be a far more convincing and engaging communicator.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">When <strong>touching</strong> other people, this needs to be appropriate and with the other person’s permission if possible. Shaking hands is usually acceptable and encouraged, but touching elsewhere needs to be done with caution. If a customer seems to need a helping hand to get up from a seat, for instance, we should offer help and ask if it is all right to hold their arm before we intervene. If our job involves touching people as part of our everyday activities, we will have guidelines about how to ask for permission and deal with difficult situations. If touching is inappropriate or unwanted, it can make communication extremely difficult and ineffective.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">Professional <strong>behaviour</strong> is another important non-verbal influence on communication. We all need to behave in a calm, polite and professional manner at all times in the workplace, however stressed or upset we might feel. This helps to gain respect and co-operation from other people and supports our verbal communication. For example, if staff members are seen running round, screaming and messing about, their words are less likely to be taken seriously. It would be hard to take them seriously if the behaviour is inappropriate and seemingly out of control.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">The importance of <strong>good personal grooming</strong> should not be underestimated. Every member of the organisation needs to make sure that they are:</p>

                <figure class="shape-30" data-animate="9" style="opacity:.2; right:5%; bottom: 25%; z-index: -1">
                    <img src="../images/_shapes/dec-s3.svg" />
                </figure>

                <ul data-animate="5">
                    <li>clean and fresh – body odour and bad breath are off-putting to colleagues, customers and others</li>
                    <li>tidy and presentable – with clean and tidy hair</li>
                    <li>correctly dressed – e.g. in a clean uniform or other work clothes</li>
                    <li>wearing the correct footwear – e.g. safety boots or smart, clean shoes.</li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="4">A smart appearance supports the person delivering verbal messages in the same way that gestures and body language do. We all make conscious and subconscious judgements about each other, especially when we first meet, so it is important to come across as trustworthy, professional and capable in the workplace.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">Non-verbal communication can influence verbal communication:</p>

                <ul data-animate="5">
                    <li>in a positive way – when gestures, appearance, posture and body language are positive and support the verbal messages</li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="4">or</p>

                <ul data-animate="5">
                    <li>in a negative way – if gestures etc are negative and undermine the verbal messages</li>
                </ul>
