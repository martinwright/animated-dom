                <p data-animate="*">Organisations have a range of contractual and statutory duties which affect the way products or
                    services can be delivered.</p>

                <p data-animate="*"><a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/29/contents" target="_blank">Trade Descriptions
                    Act</a> – This act prohibits organisations from applying a false trade description to
                    any goods. It also covers the supply or offer to supply any goods to which a false trade description
                    has been applied. Organisations are not allowed to make certain kinds of false statement about the
                    provision of any services, facilities or accommodation. This law is enforced by trading standards
                    officers. Although still in force, this Act has largely been replaced by the Consumer Protection
                    from Unfair Trading Regulations.</p>

                <p data-animate="*"><a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1987/43" target="_blank">Consumer Protection Act</a> –
                    This act protects the public by prohibiting the manufacture and supply of
                    unsafe goods; making the manufacturer or seller of a defective product responsible for damage it
                    causes; allowing local councils to seize unsafe goods and suspend the sale of suspected unsafe
                    goods; and prohibiting misleading price indications. Customers can claim compensation for death,
                    injury or damage to property over a certain amount if a product they use turns out to be faulty.
                    Producers and distributors of goods are required to ensure that their products are safe and it is an
                    offence to display or to give a customer misleading information.</p>
