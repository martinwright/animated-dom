                <p>Organisations have a range of contractual and statutory duties which affect the way products or
                    services can be delivered.</p>

                <p>Trade Descriptions Act – This act prohibits organisations from applying a false trade description to
                    any goods. It also covers the supply or offer to supply any goods to which a false trade description
                    has been applied. Organisations are not allowed to make certain kinds of false statement about the
                    provision of any services, facilities or accommodation. This law is enforced by trading standards
                    officers. Although still in force, this Act has largely been replaced by the Consumer Protection
                    from Unfair Trading Regulations.</p>

                <p>Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 – Protects consumers from unfair or
                    misleading trading practices and bans misleading omissions and aggressive sales tactics.</p>

                <p>Consumer Protection Act – This act protects the public by prohibiting the manufacture and supply of
                    unsafe goods; making the manufacturer or seller of a defective product responsible for damage it
                    causes; allowing local councils to seize unsafe goods and suspend the sale of suspected unsafe
                    goods; and prohibiting misleading price indications. Customers can claim compensation for death,
                    injury or damage to property over a certain amount if a product they use turns out to be faulty.
                    Producers and distributors of goods are required to ensure that their products are safe and it is an
                    offence to display or to give a customer misleading information..</p>

                <p>Consumer Credit Act – This act regulates consumer credit and covers areas such as: eligibility for
                    credit schemes, cooling-off periods, content of credit agreements and calculation of APR.</p>

                <p>Misrepresentation Act 1967 – This act exists to protect consumers from false or fraudulent claims
                    that induce you into buying something or entering a contract. The Act allows you to claim damages in
                    the case of fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>

                <p>Consumer Contracts Regulations – Give customers rights when shopping online, so they are covered if
                    things go wrong.</p>

                <p>Consumer Rights Act – Replaced three major pieces of consumer legislation – the Sale of Goods Act,
                    Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations and the Supply of Goods and Services Act. It was
                    introduced to simplify, strengthen and modernise the law, giving customers clearer shopping
                    rights.</p>
