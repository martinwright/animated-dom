                <p>When considering HR procedures and legal requirements, managers need to be aware of:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Services (Acas)
                    </li>

                    <li>employment tribunals
                    </li>

                    <li>legal aspects of the disciplinary process.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Acas</h5>

                <p>This is a non-departmental government public body that is sponsored by the Department for Business,
                    Innovation and Skills. It provides information, advice, training, conciliation and other services
                    for employers and employees to help prevent or resolve workplace problems.</p>

                <p>The LINK website LINK contains a great deal of information about a wide range of employment-related
                    subjects – eg rights and responsibilities at work, good practice, disputes and problems.</p>

                <p>Acas has a statutory LINK Code of Practice LINK on discipline and grievance, which gives basic,
                    practical guidance to employers, employees and their representatives. It gives guidance about how to
                    proceed fairly with disciplinary and grievance issues.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Employment tribunals</h5>

                <p>A tribunal is like a court. LINK Employment tribunals LINK are independent, public bodies with
                    statutory powers
                    to hear many kinds of disputes between employers and employees. The most common disputes are about
                    unfair dismissal, redundancy and discrimination.</p>

                <p>Employment tribunals are less formal than a court, but they are open to the public and evidence is
                    given under oath or affirmation. If the tribunal finds that the employer has breached the employee’s
                    employment rights, they can order the employer to pay penalties on top of any award made to the
                    claimant.</p>

                <p>Employment tribunals are legally required to take the Acas Code of Practice into account when
                    considering relevant cases.</p>

                <p>Before lodging a claim, Acas must be notified first to see if conciliation is possible, which is
                    faster, cheaper and less stressful.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Legal aspects of the disciplinary process</h5>

                <p>In addition to legislation, we have the Acas statutory Code of Practice on discipline and grievance.
                    This gives basic, practical guidance to employers, employees and their representatives and deals
                    with:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>disciplinary situations</strong><br>– including misconduct and poor performance
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>grievances</strong><br>– concerns, problems or complaints that employees raise with
                        their employers.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The Code does not deal with redundancy dismissals or the non-renewal of fixed-term contracts. The law
                    on unfair dismissal requires employers to act reasonably when dealing with disciplinary issues. What
                    is classed as reasonable behaviour will depend on the circumstances of each case, and is ultimately
                    a matter for employment tribunals to decide. However, the core principles are set out in the Acas
                    Code of Practice.</p>

                <p>Organisations do not have to follow the Code, but a tribunal can increase any award they have made by
                    up to 25% if it feels that an employer has unreasonably failed to follow the guidance set out in the
                    Code. It can also reduce any award they have made by up to 25% if they feel an employee has
                    unreasonably failed to follow the guidance set out in the Code.</p>

                <p>The Code supports fairness and transparency, especially when following the disciplinary process:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Employers and employees should raise and deal with issues promptly and should not unreasonably
                        delay meetings, decisions or confirmation of those decisions.
                    </li>

                    <li>Employers and employees should act consistently.
                    </li>

                    <li>Employers should carry out any necessary investigations, to establish the facts of the case.
                    </li>

                    <li>Employers should inform employees of the basis of the problem and give them an opportunity to
                        put their case in response before any decisions are made.
                    </li>

                    <li>Employers should allow employees to be accompanied at any formal disciplinary or grievance
                        meeting.
                    </li>

                    <li>Employers should allow an employee to appeal against any formal decision made.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>To make sure that they comply with legal requirements, organisations usually base their disciplinary
                    process on the <strong>Acas Code of Practice</strong>. The main themes are to be fair and
                    consistent, and to deal
                    with things without any unreasonable delays.</p>

                <p>The Code recommends that employers carry out investigations as soon as possible to establish the
                    facts and keep suspension periods with pay as brief as possible.</p>

                <p>Investigations do not necessarily have to lead to a disciplinary hearing. If they can, in the
                    interests of fairness, employers should arrange for one set of people to do the investigation and
                    one set to do the disciplinary hearing for cases of misconduct.</p>

                <p>When dealing with a disciplinary situation, the Acas Code of Practice recommends that employers:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>establish the facts of each case
                    </li>

                    <li>inform the employee of the problem
                    </li>

                    <li>hold a meeting to discuss the problem
                    </li>

                    <li>allow the employee to be accompanied at the meeting
                    </li>

                    <li>decide on appropriate action
                    </li>

                    <li>provide employees with an opportunity to appeal.
                    </li>
                </ul>
