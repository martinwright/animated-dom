                <p>The main employment legislation in the UK is the Employment Rights Act 1996. This law is very
                    detailed and deals with a huge number of aspects about employment. Some of the main points covered
                    by the Act are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>the employee’s right to have a statement or contract of employment</strong>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>the employee’s right to have an itemised pay statement</strong>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>protection of wages</strong>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>protection from suffering detriment in employment from taking time off work –</strong> eg taking time off for jury service, family reasons or antenatal care
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>sickness</strong>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>maternity, paternity and adoption payments and leave</strong>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>suspension from work</strong>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>procedures for discipline, grievance, dismissal and redundancy</strong>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Sunday working and time off.</strong>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Employment law is constantly under review and revision, with additions and changes happening every
                    year, so it is important for managers and their organisations to keep up to date with the latest
                    legislation and regulations.</p>

                <p>It helps if line managers are aware of their rights and those of their team members, so that they can
                    apply disciplinary processes fairly, and act if the employer does not comply with this Act.</p>
