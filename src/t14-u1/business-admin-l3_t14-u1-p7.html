                <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the European Union’s (EU) framework for data
                    protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU. It replaced the UK’s Data Protection Act
                    on 25 May 2018. This regulation has expanded the definition of ‘personal data’ to include
                    information such as online identifiers (IP addresses) to reflect the changes in technology and the
                    way organisations collect information about individuals.</p>

            </section>

                    <img src="../images/_shapes/hex-s15.svg" />
                </figure>

                <p>The GDPR provides the following rights for individuals:</p>

                <p><strong>1. The right to be informed </strong>– Organisations have an obligation to provide ‘fair
                    processing
                    information’ typically through the use of privacy notices. The GDPR sets out the information that
                    organisations should supply and when individuals should be informed. The information supplied about
                    the processing of personal data must be:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible
                    </li>

                    <li>written in clear and plain language, particularly if addressed to a child; and free of charge.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p><strong>2. The right of access </strong>– Under the GDPR, individuals will have the right to obtain:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>confirmation that their data is being processed
                    </li>

                    <li>access to their personal data
                    </li>

                    <li>other supplementary information – this largely corresponds to the information that should be
                        provided in a privacy notice.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>3. The right of rectification </strong>– Individuals are entitled to have personal data
                    rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete.</p>

                <p><strong>4. The right to erasure </strong>– An individual can request the deletion or removal of
                    personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing.</p>

                <p><strong>5. The right to restrict processing </strong>– Under the GDPR, individuals have a right to
                    ‘block’ or suppress processing of personal data. When processing is restricted, organisations are
                    permitted to store the personal data, but not to process it.</p>

                <p><strong>6. The right to data portability </strong>– Allows individuals to obtain and reuse their
                    personal data for their own purposes across different services.</p>

                <p><strong>7. The right to object </strong>– Individuals have the right to object to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>processing based on legitimate interests or the performance of a task in the public
                        interest/exercise of official authority (including profiling)
                    </li>

                    <li>direct marketing (including profiling)
                    </li>

                    <li>processing for purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>8. Rights related to automated decision making including profiling </strong>– The GDPR has
                    been expanded to apply to all automated individual decision making and profiling. Organisations can
                    only carry out this type of decision making where the decision is:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>necessary for the entry into or performance of a contract
                    </li>

                    <li>authorised by the EU or a member state's law applicable to the controller
                    </li>

                    <li>based on the individual’s explicit consent.
                    </li>
                </ul>
