                <div class="p-60">

                <p>This Act deals with the employer’s duty of care to all staff, customers and other people connected
                    with the organisation, plus employees’ rights and responsibilities. HR procedures, especially
                    disciplinary actions, could arise if, for example, a member of staff:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>refuses to wear the personal protective equipment (PPE) that has been issued that they are
                        required to wear for their job
                    </li>

                    <li>does not follow manufacturers' instructions and training about how to use and operate materials,
                        equipment or machinery
                    </li>

                    <li>abuses or misuses equipment or machinery.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>It is a legal requirement for health and safety procedures to be in place in the workplace.
                    Organisations have a responsibility for the welfare of their employees, customers and anyone else
                    who comes to the workplace, and employees have a responsibility to follow the procedures.</p>

                <p>Employers and employees share responsibility for security, health and safety. In general terms,
                    employers need to put all of the procedures and equipment in place, and employees need to follow
                    instructions and use everything correctly.</p>
