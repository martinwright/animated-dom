                <h4 data-animate="2">7 Recruitment and selection</h4>

                <p>The anti-discrimination measures under the Equality Act 2010 also apply to the recruitment and
                    selection process. Job applicants have to be treated fairly, as well as employees and trainees. If
                    an applicant believes that they have been discriminated against unfairly during the recruitment
                    process, they can take the organisation to an employment tribunal.</p>

                <p>Employers need to avoid discrimination during the recruitment and selection process by, for
                    example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>advertising the job correctly
                    </li>

                    <li>making the interview process and location accessible
                    </li>

                    <li>avoiding certain questions when recruiting
                    </li>

                    <li>avoiding certain topics during the application process.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Advertising the job correctly</h5>

                <p>Employers must not state or imply that they will discriminate against anyone. Phrases such as ‘recent
                    graduate’ or ‘highly experienced’ should be used only if they are actual requirements of the job.
                    These phrases could discriminate against younger or older people who have not had the opportunity to
                    get certain qualifications, so the criteria must be essential for the job. Indirect discrimination
                    can occur by advertising the job only in men’s magazines, for instance.</p>

                    <img src="../images/_shapes/dia-s8.svg" />
                </figure>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Making the interview process and location accessible</h5>

                <p>Employers need to make practicable adjustments to make sure that the widest number of people have
                    access. For example, candidates in wheelchairs or with mobility problems might need to use ramps and
                    lifts to reach the interview room and workplace.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Avoiding certain questions when recruiting</h5>

                <p>Employers cannot ask applicants about protected characteristics, their health, their marital status,
                    if they have children or if they plan to have children. Employers can only ask about these things
                    if:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>there are necessary requirements of the job that cannot be met by reasonable adjustments
                    </li>

                    <li>they are finding out if someone needs help to take part in a selection test or interview
                    </li>

                    <li>they are using ‘positive action’ to recruit people who are disabled or from another minority
                        group.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Avoiding certain topics during the application process</h5>

                <p>Certain topics that may influence a decision unfairly and cause discrimination are avoided during the
                    selection process. For example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>the candidate’s date of birth – this can be used for monitoring only and is not allowed on the
                        main application form
                    </li>

                    <li>criminal convictions if they are spent – some employers are exempt from this rule, such as
                        schools
                    </li>

                    <li>trade union membership.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Employers can discriminate, but only if it is a requirement for the job. For example, people under 18
                    cannot sell alcohol, so it would not be illegal to put a lower age limit on the job
                    specification.</p>
