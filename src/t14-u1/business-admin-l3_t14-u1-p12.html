                <h4 data-animate="*">9 Sickness and absence</h4>

                <div class="p-60">

                <p data-animate="*">Managing attendance problems often means that managers have to tackle the causes of absence.</p>

                <p data-animate="*">People are absent from work for three main reasons:</p>

                <ul data-animate="*">
                    <li>sickness
                    </li>

                    <li>family or caring responsibilities
                    </li>

                    <li>authorised leave – eg holiday, maternity leave or a training course.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="*">As well as organising and co-ordinating these absences, managers may need to deal with problems such
                    as lateness and poor timekeeping, plus unauthorised absence, which may eventually lead to
                    disciplinary action.</p>

                <p data-animate="*">There are legal requirements under the Employment Rights Act 1996 that managers need to be aware of,
                    as employers must:</p>

                <ul data-animate="*">
                    <li>protect employees when taking time off work in certain situations
                    </li>

                    <li>pay Statutory Sick Pay (SSP)
                    </li>

                    <li>pay maternity, paternity and adoption payments
                    </li>

                    <li>allow maternity, paternity and adoption leave
                    </li>

                    <li>deal with suspension from work correctly.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="*">Managers are required to comply with these regulations when dealing with HR matters, to make sure
                    that the individual’s and the organisation’s rights are protected. This helps to maintain good
                    working relationships and avoid grievances and possible legal action or tribunals. Full details can
                    be found on the Acas website.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="*">Protection from suffering detriment in employment and taking time off work</h5>

                <p data-animate="*">This protects employees’ rights to not suffer from, for example: doing jury service or public duties;
                    having time off for study or for family or domestic reasons; taking time off for antenatal care.
                    Managers need to be aware of this protection so that they can arrange reasonable time off, support a
                    team member, inform HR when appropriate and monitor the situation.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="*">Sickness</h5>

                <p data-animate="*">Employers must pay Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) when employees have been off work sick for four or more
                    days in a row (including non-working days). Managers may be involved with contacting and supporting
                    the team member who is unwell, keeping sickness records for the payroll and HR departments, and
                    escalating the problem to HR when appropriate.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="*">Maternity, paternity and adoption payments and leave</h5>

                <p data-animate="*">Pregnant women have several rights, including Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP), maternity leave, time
                    off for appointments and the right to return to work. Fathers have paternity rights that include
                    paid paternity leave, Statutory Paternity Pay (SPP) and additional paternity leave. Statutory
                    Adoption Pay (SAP) was added in a later amendment to the Act. Parents can also have the right to
                    paid time off for family emergencies, flexible working and for adoption leave.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="*">Suspension from work</h5>

                <p data-animate="*">There are rights to remuneration when someone is suspended from work on medical or maternity
                    grounds.</p>
