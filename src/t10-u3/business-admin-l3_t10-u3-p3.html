                <h2 class="sub-heading" data-animate="2">Organisational culture</h2>

                <p data-animate=“*”>Organisational culture can affect many different functions including, for example:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li data-animate="9"><strong>Health and safety</strong> &ndash; eg a manufacturing company has a good
                        safety culture that keeps accidents and incidents to a minimum.
                    </li>

                    <li data-animate="9"><strong>Working hours</strong> &ndash; eg employees in a City finance firm always
                        work longer hours than are shown in their contracts; subcontractors tend to finish on time and
                        leave tasks unfinished each evening.
                    </li>

                    <li data-animate="9"><strong>Sales targets</strong> &ndash; eg an insurance company’s call centre’s
                        culture is very hard sell to make sure targets are met, regardless of quality; a specialist
                        furniture supplier’s culture focuses on the quality and profitability of sales, and not the
                        quantity.
                    </li>

                    <li data-animate="9"><strong>Quality management</strong> &ndash; eg a car company’s culture is to strive
                        for consistent excellence and 100% accuracy in production; a food factory’s staff do not really
                        care about high levels of wastage as these have always been ignored.
                    </li>

                    <li data-animate="9"><strong>Employees’ health and work-life balance</strong> &ndash; eg a small
                        company’s culture is to always support its loyal and hard-working employees if they are sick or
                        have serious personal problems; another company’s culture is for staff to turn up for work even
                        if they are ill.
                    </li>

                    <li data-animate="9"><strong>Delivering on promises</strong> &ndash; eg a retail company’s culture is to
                        treat its customers and other stakeholders with honesty and integrity; a plumbing business’s
                        culture is to not care if customers complain about missed appointments or staff turning up later
                        than promised.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p data-animate=“*”>An organisation can have clearly stated objectives and a mission statement, but these may not be in
                    line with the reality of its culture – how things are actually done. It is part of the leadership
                    role to work to align the organisation’s culture with its overall vision and goals – to aim to make
                    the unwritten rules match the written ones.</p>

                <p data-animate=“*”>We will consider:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li>different cultures that exist within organisations</li>

                    <li>internal and external factors that can affect the culture</li>

                    <li>the effect the organisation’s culture can have on individuals and teams.</li>
                </ul>
