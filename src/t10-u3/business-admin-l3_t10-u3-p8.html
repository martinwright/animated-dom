                <h4 data-animate="2">5 Person culture</h4>

                <p>This is an unusual culture where the main focus is on the individual, represented by a loose cluster
                    of stars. If there is a structure at all, it is focused on the individuals within it. The primary
                    focus is on individuals, who tend to be experts or specialists, who can make demands and insist on
                    doing things their way.</p>

                <p>Organisations with this culture:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>do not have management hierarchies – as everything has to be decided by mutual consent
                    </li>

                    <li>base power on experts and specialists.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>People working in a person culture include, for example: freelance specialists who work alone or on
                    contract with an organisation; hospital consultants; successful entertainers in theatre, television
                    or film; writers, artists or other creative professionals. These people can be difficult to manage
                    as they can usually find work elsewhere and may not acknowledge anyone as being in a position of
                    power that is greater than their own.</p>

                    <img src="../images/_shapes/dia-s15.svg" />
                </figure>

            </section>

            <section>

                <figure class="shape-105" data-animate="2" style="position: relative; top:-1em; right:0em; z-index: -2">
                    <img src="../images/t10-u3/organisational_culture_book_05.jpg" />

                    <figure class="shape-20" data-animate="9" style="opacity:.9; left:71%; bottom: -12%;">
                        <img src="../images/_shapes/hex-s9.svg" />
                    </figure>

                </figure>

                <p>These styles are not fixed and most organisations will have a mixture of these cultures that reflects
                    their operational needs and circumstances. There can even be different cultures within the same
                    organisation – eg between different departments, offices or functional areas. For example, an agency
                    that deals with sports and entertainment celebrities could have:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>a person culture – when dealing with the clients who are freelance specialists in their field
                    </li>

                    <li>a task culture – for its own employees, especially when organising events, sponsors, deals,
                        marketing or networking opportunities for clients
                    </li>

                    <li>a role structure – in the accounts department who deal with all financial and administrative
                        back-up.
                    </li>
                </ul>
