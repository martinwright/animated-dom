                <p>In this section we are going to look at the importance of organisational culture, which can be
                    described as ‘how we do things around here’.</p>

                <p>Organisational culture is a set of unwritten rules that will affect how employees and other
                    stakeholders behave and perform. These unofficial guidelines are often based on assumptions, values,
                    beliefs, history and hidden rules, and they can affect every aspect of how the organisation operates
                    and gets work done.</p>

                <p>When we are immersed in a workplace culture, we often just go along with things without questioning
                    them too closely. We want to fit in with other people, especially if we are new. If the culture is
                    positive, productive, fair and trustworthy, we will usually do our best to work hard to meet the
                    standards and become an effective member of the organisation and team. On the other hand, if the
                    culture is based on negative and generally unacceptable values, we can feel uncomfortable about
                    challenging things that do not seem quite right. The underlying positive or negative cultural
                    elements have a significant effect on the whole organisation.</p>
