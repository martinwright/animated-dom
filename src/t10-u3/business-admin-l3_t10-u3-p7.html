                     alt=""

                <p>This culture is focused on tasks, jobs or projects. It can be illustrated as a net, with a series of
                    different strands and knots, with the power and influence located at the knots.</p>

                <p>Organisations with this structure:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>often have structures based on projects or a matrix
                    </li>

                    <li>focus on bringing together appropriate human and physical resources for each project
                    </li>

                    <li>depend on the team’s work – rather than an individual’s output
                    </li>

                    <li>focus power on experts rather than personal position or status – bringing in the best people for
                        a particular project according to their skills rather than their seniority or status
                    </li>

                    <li>set up new groups or teams for each project
                    </li>

                    <li>can adapt to change quickly and effectively
                    </li>

                    <li>cannot operate as well if resources are not freely available – as staff become distracted by the
                        need to compete for resources to complete their tasks and projects.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p>This culture is most in tune with current trends of change and flexibility, individual freedom and
                    fewer distinctions between people with different backgrounds or status. Its emphasis on teamwork,
                    expert power and results-based rewards make the culture appealing to many.</p>
