                <p>An organisational strategy sets out the organisation’s vision and purpose, upon which future,
                    long-term developments will be based. It provides a framework for managers that informs the way they
                    plan and deliver products and services, and how they manage their teams and departments.</p>

                <p>The <strong>organisational strategy</strong> sets out the <strong>broad picture</strong> and will often cover several years. The
                    <strong>details</strong> about resources, activities and performance measurements that will be needed to achieve the
                    objectives set out in the strategy are contained within the <strong>operational plans</strong> for each team and
                    department. These will include all aspects of the day-to-day running of the organisation as well as
                    how team and departmental objectives tie in with the overall goals of the organisation.</p>

                <p>Real-life examples can be found online by entering ‘organisational strategy’ into a search engine.</p>

            <section>

                <p>In this section, we are going to look at:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>the process of developing organisational strategy
                    </li>

                    <li>how operational plans relate to organisational strategy.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>When we work out strategy at any level, the principles are based on the same four questions:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Where are we now?
                    </li>

                    <li>Where do we need and want to be?
                    </li>

                    <li>How do we get there?
                    </li>

                    <li>How will we measure progress and success?
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>When developing organisational strategy, these questions still apply. We need to consider, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Current internal and external factors that affect the organisation – where are we now?
                    </li>

                    <li>The formulation of high-level strategy – where do we need to be and how do we plan to get there?
                    </li>

                    <li>Translating the high-level plans into operational plans for departments and teams – the
                        practical steps that will actually get us to where we want and need to be, and how we measure
                        progress and success.
                    </li>
                </ul>
