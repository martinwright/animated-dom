                <figure class="shape-100" data-animate="2" style="position: relative; top:0; left:-1em; z-index: -2">
                    <img src="../images/t10-u3/different_problem_02.jpg" />

                    <figure class="shape-20" data-animate="9" data-type="roll-from-left" style="opacity:.9; right:5%; top: -12%;">

                </figure>

                <p>When preparing high-level strategy, the first question – <strong>where are we now?</strong> – needs
                    to be addressed. Senior managers and directors will, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>analyse current and recent operational data</strong> &mdash; eg from accounts, sales figures
                        or feedback comments
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>identify influences</strong> &mdash; eg looking at results from the PESTLE analysis
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>identify actual and potential problems</strong> &mdash; eg changes in the supply chain;
                        changes in technology; changes in customers’ expectations and spending patterns
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>provide evidence to support claims</strong> &mdash; eg providing figures from previous
                        successful projects or competitors’ activities, or market research figures to illustrate demand
                        for products and services.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The second question – <strong>where do we want and need to be?</strong> – helps the organisation to focus on its
                    vision and purpose and senior managers and directors need to consider how they will, for
                    example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>present the organisation’s vision and purpose</strong> &mdash; eg showing how development
                        plans remain true to the original vision (main goals) and purpose (the reasons for existing and
                        operating); explaining any changes to the original vision and purpose
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>clarify the development plans and ideas</strong> &mdash; eg to build a second factory; to set
                        up a new company or department; to change from high-street outlets to online outlets
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>set goals</strong> &mdash; eg targets, objectives and deadlines for the coming months and
                        years; projections for sales and other income.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </section>

            <section>

                <p>The third question – <strong>how do we get there?</strong> – forms the basis of operational plans of
                    how to achieve functional objectives. Decision-makers need to work out, for example, how they will:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>allocate budgets</strong> &mdash; eg for heads of departments and teams to follow and use
                        when planning their resources and schedules; to show shareholders how funds will be used
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>create financial forecasts</strong> &mdash; eg to show the bank when asking for business
                        loans; to illustrate where the organisation expects to be financially at a given time
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>convince people to support the organisation</strong> &mdash; eg customers, suppliers,
                        shareholders or potential employees
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>allocate physical resources</strong> &mdash; eg the current supply chain, costs, reliability
                        and sustainability; physical assets owned by the organisation
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>assess human resources needed</strong> &mdash; eg the current workforce and scope to recruit
                        and train new staff
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>set timescales for achieving the main goals</strong> &mdash; eg for different key stages of
                        development.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The final question – <strong>how do we measure progress and success?</strong> – covers how the
                    high-level strategy will compare the actual progress with targets set out in plans by using, for
                    example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>timescales, deadlines and targets</strong>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>critical review points</strong> &mdash; eg at the end of different stages to make sure that
                        everything is on track
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>monitoring techniques</strong> &mdash; eg against key performance indicators (KPIs); using
                        Gantt charts
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>measuring increased income, sales or numbers of customers</strong>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>customer feedback, loyalty and retention</strong>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>public and media reactions.</strong>
                    </li>
                </ul>
