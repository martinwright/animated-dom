                <h4 data-animate="2">3 The formulation of high-level strategy</h4>

                <img src="../images/t10-u3/different_problem_02.jpg"
                     alt=""
                     style="width:100%;"
                     data-animate="6"/>

                <p>When preparing high-level strategy, the first question – <strong>where are we now?</strong> – needs
                    to be addressed. Senior managers and directors will, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>analyse current and recent operational data</strong><br>eg from accounts, sales figures
                        or feedback comments
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>identify influences</strong><br>eg looking at results from the PESTLE analysis
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>identify actual and potential problems</strong><br>eg changes in the supply chain;
                        changes in technology; changes in customers’ expectations and spending patterns
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>provide evidence to support claims</strong><br>eg providing figures from previous
                        successful projects or competitors’ activities, or market research figures to illustrate demand
                        for products and services.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The second question – <strong>where do we want and need to be?</strong> – helps the organisation to focus on its
                    vision and purpose and senior managers and directors need to consider how they will, for
                    example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>present the organisation’s vision and purpose</strong><br>eg showing how development
                        plans remain true to the original vision (main goals) and purpose (the reasons for existing and
                        operating); explaining any changes to the original vision and purpose
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>clarify the development plans and ideas</strong><br>eg to build a second factory; to set
                        up a new company or department; to change from high-street outlets to online outlets
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>set goals</strong><br>eg targets, objectives and deadlines for the coming months and
                        years; projections for sales and other income.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The third question – <strong>how do we get there?</strong> – forms the basis of operational plans of
                    how to achieve functional objectives. Decision-makers need to work out, for example, how they will:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>allocate budgets</strong><br>eg for heads of departments and teams to follow and use
                        when planning their resources and schedules; to show shareholders how funds will be used
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>create financial forecasts</strong><br>eg to show the bank when asking for business
                        loans; to illustrate where the organisation expects to be financially at a given time
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>convince people to support the organisation</strong><br>eg customers, suppliers,
                        shareholders or potential employees
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>allocate physical resources</strong><br>eg the current supply chain, costs, reliability
                        and sustainability; physical assets owned by the organisation
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>assess human resources needed</strong><br>eg the current workforce and scope to recruit
                        and train new staff
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>set timescales for achieving the main goals</strong><br>eg for different key stages of
                        development.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The final question – <strong>how do we measure progress and success?</strong> – covers how the
                    high-level strategy will compare the actual progress with targets set out in plans by using, for
                    example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>timescales, deadlines and targets</strong>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>critical review points</strong><br>eg at the end of different stages to make sure that
                        everything is on track
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>monitoring techniques</strong><br>eg against key performance indicators (KPIs); using
                        Gantt charts
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>measuring increased income, sales or numbers of customers</strong>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>customer feedback, loyalty and retention</strong>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>public and media reactions.</strong>
                    </li>
                </ul>
