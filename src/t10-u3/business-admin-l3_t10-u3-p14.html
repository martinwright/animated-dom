                <img src="../images/t10-u3/the_process_developing_05.jpg"
                     alt=""
                     style="width:100%;"
                     data-animate="6"/>

                <p>The high-level plans only contain the framework for managers to use when delivering products and
                    services, and managing their team. The principles and elements need to be broken down into smaller
                    components that are relevant for each department and team, and turned into operational plans.</p>

                <p>The operational plans will be based on the information that the organisation cascades down to
                    managers of departments and teams and could include, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>objectives for each team and department</strong><br>eg the output and quality that is
                        required from each team; deadlines and how they affect other departments
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>new policies and procedures</strong><br>eg how to deal with new problems and queries
                        from colleagues, suppliers or customers
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>updated standards and deadlines</strong><br>eg for customer service and delivery times.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Managers can then analyse and assess their own teamâ€™s current position and develop operational plans
                    about how they are going to achieve their part of the organisational, long-term goals. They need to
                    review, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>physical resources</strong><br>eg the stocks and supplies for each area of the
                        workplace; machinery and equipment the team can use; updated offices for an updated department
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>human resources needed</strong><br>eg planned training sessions for current team
                        members; recruitment and training plans for each department; planned agency staff and
                        contractors to help the team
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>financial resources</strong><br>eg budgets allocated for each function in the department
                        or team; the contingency funds that are available and how to request extra money
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>time</strong><br>eg different key stages and targets for each department and team
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>measuring progress and success</strong><br>eg new processes to measure output against
                        forecasts; quality control procedures.
                    </li>
                </ul>
