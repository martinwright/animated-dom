                <img src="../images/t10-u3/how_operational_plans_01.jpg"
                     alt=""
                     style="width:100%;"
                     data-animate="6"/>

                <p>It is important for team and departmental goals to align with the goals and guidelines of the
                    organisation. For a team to reach its goals, it needs to operate within the organisation’s
                    guidelines so that the results are compatible with overall objectives and requirements.</p>

                <p>A department or team is a group of people who work together towards a common purpose. They work
                    together, using their various skills and strengths to achieve goals and objectives, and they are
                    accountable for their actions.</p>

                <p>For example, an organisation like a football club team will have the <strong>common sense of
                    purpose</strong> of winning championships and competitions. Some players on the team will work in
                    defensive positions, others will be in attacking roles, and some will do a mixture of both. Behind
                    the scenes, there will be other teams and departments that support the players, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>a coaching team – with specialist coaches for different skills
                    </li>

                    <li>a medical team – with physiotherapists and other healthcare professionals
                    </li>

                    <li>an administration department – that looks after accounts, wages, ticket revenue etc
                    </li>

                    <li>sales and marketing – looking after advertising and sponsorship
                    </li>

                    <li>a youth academy – supporting and training young players for the future
                    </li>

                    <li>a facilities management team – eg cleaners, stewards, laundry, car parking and venue management
                    </li>

                    <li>a senior management team and shareholders.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>They work as one unit to achieve objectives, win matches, learn from their mistakes and earn
                    sufficient points over the season to win the championship or competition. All of the teams and
                    departments must work together for the organisation to achieve its goals and enjoy success. They are
                    all valuable and the football team would not be able to achieve sustainable success without the
                    back-up and support of all the other teams.</p>

                <p>The same principles apply in a workplace team or department. The common sense of purpose will be
                    linked to the long-term goals the organisation sets out in its strategy – eg to be a consistently
                    high-quality, sustainable and reliable manufacturer of goods and services.</p>

                <p>A common sense of purpose is crucial so that everyone knows and understands the goal that they are
                    aiming for. Team members also need to believe in the common purpose, so that they can all work
                    together and give their best performance. The sports team, for instance, will lose strength and
                    effectiveness if some of the team members do not share the objective and focus of winning the
                    championship or competition. The same applies in the workplace. If some team members do not share
                    the common sense of purpose, their influence on others might be negative and could jeopardise the
                    overall success of the team in its activities.</p>
