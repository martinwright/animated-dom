                <h4 data-animate="2">2 Why these objectives need to be SMART</h4>

                <p>Many organisations use SMART targets as they provide a logical and simple template of how to set and
                    monitor objectives and activities. The objectives need to be:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Specific</strong><br>to identify the objective and desired outcome clearly, and to show
                        the action and resources required.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Measurable</strong><br>so that everyone can see the schedule of work, track progress and
                        measure success.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Achievable</strong><br>to make sure that the objective is within the scope of the team’s
                        abilities and available resources.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Realistic</strong><br>to make sure that everything is achievable with the time, working
                        methods and resources that are available.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Time-bound</strong><br>deadlines that are aligned with the organisational targets give a
                        focus for individuals, the team and the organisation.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Once managers have agreed the objectives with the rest of the organisation, they can involve team
                    leaders and team members in creating SMART objectives or targets that align with achieving the
                    organisational targets. The SMART objectives can focus on the team as a whole or on individual team
                    members.</p>

            <section>

                <p>By involving team members in agreeing and setting objectives, the benefits can include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Improved motivation and empowerment</strong><br>Team members feel valued and integral
                        parts of the whole process. By taking responsibility and ownership of the project, they are more
                        likely to engage and enjoy the challenge of achieving the objectives. Assisting in the planning
                        of objectives encourages trust and inspires team members to develop their own personal growth
                        and be part of the achievement culture. It also empowers people by giving them the opportunity
                        to voice concerns and discuss potential problems early on in the process.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Improved decision making</strong><br>The openness that features when planning objectives
                        together should feature in all elements of the project. Good communication links allow
                        information about progress, problems and changes to flow effectively. In addition, team members
                        are more likely to prioritise their own activities when they can see the overall impact of their
                        decisions.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Increased productivity and product quality</strong><br>Team members can offer useful
                        suggestions, opinions and creative ideas at the beginning of a project or task that can improve
                        the whole process. Being part of the process, from planning objectives to the final delivery,
                        encourages people to take ownership and deal with problems and changes more quickly and
                        effectively. It is in their interests to be part of success, not failure.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Clarity and focus</strong><br>When individual team members can see how their objectives
                        tie in with those of the team and the organisation, they have a clearer view of the overall aims
                        and reasons behind decisions. This focuses their attention and gives them direction.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Collaboration when setting objectives helps to ensure the team’s success and achievement of team and
                    organisational goals. When team members have been part of the planning process, they are more
                    engaged and determined to see a satisfactory outcome, which benefits the team members, managers and
                    organisation. The openness about planning and agreeing the objectives can continue, making it easier
                    to focus the team’s attention, keep an eye on problems, and to achieve and measure success.</p>
