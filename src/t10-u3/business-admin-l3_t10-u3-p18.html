                <h4 data-animate="2">3 How departments and teams support each other</h4>

                <p>As we could see in the example about the football club, the different teams and departments were
                    dependent on each other. This is the same in the workplace. The actions of one team can have an
                    impact on other teams, so it is important to work together and be co-operative.</p>

                <p>Delays in one team’s work can affect another team’s work. For example, a delay caused by a
                    restaurant’s kitchen team will cause delays and difficulties for the waiting team as they need to
                    look after irate customers who are waiting for their food.</p>

                <p>Sometimes tasks need to be done in a certain order. If this does not happen, there may be a delay
                    that leads to delays for another team. When tasks impact on each other, this is a critical review
                    point that needs to be monitored and managed.</p>

            <section>

                <p>To make sure that different teams and departments can work together and support each other, managers
                    may need to have meetings to, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>discuss how organisational targets align with team and departmental goals
                    </li>

                    <li>make sure that people in all teams understand and follow the organisational standards
                    </li>

                    <li>understand each other’s team and departmental objectives, needs and expectations
                    </li>

                    <li>build relationships so that they can work together to solve problems
                    </li>

                    <li>establish and monitor critical review points to ensure everything is on track
                    </li>

                    <li>encourage early intervention when problems and delays seem possible – so that they can re-plan their activities
                    </li>

                    <li>agree to move physical and human resources to make sure that the tasks are done on time.
                    </li>
                </ul>
