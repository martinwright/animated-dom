                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Diversity</strong><br>recognising individual as well as group differences, treating
                        people as individuals and placing positive value on diversity.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Equality</strong><br>the state of being equal, especially in status, rights or
                        opportunities.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Inclusion</strong><br>the idea that all people should freely, openly and without pity
                        accommodate any person with a disability without restrictions or limitations of any kind.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Equality Act 2010</strong><br>the main law that serves to legally protect people from
                        discrimination. It replaced previous anti-discrimination laws with a single act, making the law
                        easier to understand and strengthening protection in some situations. The Act sets out the
                        different ways in which itâ€™s unlawful to treat someone. Before the Equality Act 2010 came into
                        force there were several pieces of legislation to cover discrimination, including the following:
                    </li>

                    <li>Sex Discrimination Act 1975
                    </li>

                    <li>Race Relations Act 1976.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Culture</strong><br>the set of shared attitudes, values, goals and practices that
                        characterises an organisation.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Prevailing</strong><br>usual, common or widespread.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Inappropriate</strong><br>not suitable or proper in the circumstances.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Role model</strong><br>a person who serves as an example of values, attitudes and
                        behaviours and distinguishes themselves in such a way that others admire and want to emulate
                        them.
                    </li>

                </ul>
