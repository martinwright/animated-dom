                <p data-animate=“*”>There is a difference between problem solving and decision making. They are closely linked skills
                    that are very important in leadership and management roles, but they are not the same.</p>

                <p data-animate=“*”>According to the Oxford Dictionary, definitions are:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li><strong>Problem solving</strong> &ndash; the process of finding solutions to difficult or complex issues.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Decision making</strong> &ndash; the action or process of making decisions, especially important ones.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate=“*”>We need to <strong>make decisions</strong> about how we are going to <strong>solve problems</strong>.
                    When solving a problem is our
                    ultimate objective, we need to make a series of decisions along the way. For instance, if the
                    problem we need to solve is how to pay for a holiday we have booked for six months’ time, we need to
                    make decisions about how we are going to achieve this goal.</p>

                <p data-animate=“*”>We can use our <strong>problem-solving</strong> skills to find potential solutions to our funding
                    problem and consider how we can pay for our holiday by, for example:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li>using savings that are allocated to something else – eg for a house deposit or car purchase
                    </li>

                    <li>reducing our current essential costs – eg money spent on electricity bills or motoring costs
                    </li>

                    <li>reducing the money we spend on non-essential items – eg extra clothes, shoes, entertainment and luxury goods
                    </li>

                    <li>increasing our earnings – eg from overtime or a second job
                    </li>

                    <li>borrowing money – eg taking out a loan or on a credit card
                    </li>

                    <li>sharing holiday costs with someone else – eg sharing a villa then splitting the costs with other people.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate=“*”>There are many methods that could be used to solve our problem, and we can quantify the alternative
                    actions to show how much each option could add to our holiday fund. To solve our problem, we need to
                    take action, not just write down all the options.</p>

                <p data-animate=“*”>Before we can take action, we need to use our <strong>decision-making</strong> skills to make the
                    most suitable choices. This is a process and there are many factors to consider in more detail
                    before we can decide which will be the best course of action. In this example, if we want to make a
                    decision about increasing our earnings, questions that need to be answered could include:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li>Does my current employer have any extra work? Maybe I can do some overtime.
                    </li>

                    <li>How much extra would I be paid per hour or day, after tax and national insurance?
                    </li>

                    <li>How many hours would I have to work to make the money I need?
                    </li>

                    <li>How much would I spend on travel and parking costs for the extra shifts?
                    </li>

                    <li>Would doing so much overtime affect other things in my life too much – eg health, relationships or social commitments?
                    </li>

                    <li>Is there scope to take on a second job for a while to pay for the holiday?
                    </li>

                    <li>How would I find such a job, and what would I be paid?
                    </li>
                </ul>
