                     alt=""

                <p>Good leadership is about influencing people. Leaders are innovative and they inspire and motivate
                    others to give their help and support to accomplish a common task, or develop new ideas. They focus
                    on people and set new directions for a group to follow.</p>

                <p>For example, the manager needs to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>discuss concerns and plans openly
                    </li>

                    <li>listen to people’s comments and feedback
                    </li>

                    <li>show good leadership skills – eg to inspire trust and commitment from the team; to ‘sell’ the
                        new ideas to the team and the rest of the organisation
                    </li>

                    <li>encourage team members to use their own leadership skills – eg letting them lead the group to
                        probe deeply into ideas; delegating part of the development of new ideas or a mini project
                    </li>

                    <li>offer mentoring, coaching or counselling – eg when people are having particular difficulties.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Managers also need to facilitate and organise adequate resources to support team members and others, including:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>human resources – eg recruiting new staff; retraining existing staff; changing shift patterns;
                        arranging for agency staff to cover absences and short-term staff shortages
                    </li>

                    <li>physical resources – eg setting up and monitoring the supply chain of materials; arranging
                        premises; reorganising current workplace accommodation; implementing quality controls;
                        developing health and safety risk assessments for new procedures
                    </li>

                    <li>finance – eg setting and monitoring budgets; reviewing costs.
                    </li>
                </ul>
