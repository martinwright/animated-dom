                <p>Nudge theory was made popular in the 2008 book <em>Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth and
                    Happiness</em> by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein. The theory can be used to explore and explain
                    influences that affect how people behave, and how to remove or alter them using ‘nudges’ such as
                    advertising or government information.</p>

                <p>People who advocate nudge theory use indirect methods to influence people, rather than direct
                    enforcement or instruction – eg help and assistance rather than enforcement or policing; enablement
                    and facilitation rather than legislation, rules and laws; education and information rather than
                    instruction and direction.</p>

                <p>When supporting teams through change, nudge theory helps managers to remember to make things as
                    positive as possible, and focus on indirect methods of communication. The theory relies on
                    individuals being guided rather than told what to do, so that they find their own way to success and
                    change. Team members benefit from being guided to discover new objectives, plans, knowledge, skills
                    and procedures for themselves. Learning is often simpler and more enjoyable, and they feel engaged
                    in the change and development processes.</p>
