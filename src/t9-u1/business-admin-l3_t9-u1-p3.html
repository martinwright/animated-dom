                <p data-animate=“*”>To help us to understand the basic principles of change management, it can be useful to think about
                    three key questions that illustrate the process.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Where are we now?</h5>

                <p data-animate=“*”>Organisations need to evaluate their current position. They need to look at all aspects of the
                    current operation and performance, including:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li>identifying physical and human resources
                    </li>

                    <li>measuring production or sales
                    </li>

                    <li>evaluating feedback from stakeholders, such as employees, shareholders, financial backers and
                        customers
                    </li>

                    <li>reviewing competitors’ activities and achievements.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate=“*”>This gives the organisation or team a baseline from which to develop and change the way things are
                    done.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Where do we need to be?</h5>

                <p data-animate=“*”>This is where the reasons for change come into focus and the need for innovation and change is
                    identified. For example, an organisation has decided that it needs to:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li>have a fully integrated, new computer system
                    </li>

                    <li>have a new range of products and services to meet customers’ new expectations
                    </li>

                    <li>change its processes to comply with new regulations
                    </li>

                    <li>have improved products and services that are better than those supplied by competitors.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate=“*”>This sets the targets and objectives for individuals, teams and the organisation to aim for.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">How do we get there?</h5>

                <p data-animate=“*”>The actual change processes start to become clear at this stage as people see what they need to do to
                    achieve the new objectives for the organisation. They need to create and follow action plans to show
                    the resources, deadlines and critical review points. For example, they might:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li>research and order a new IT system
                    </li>

                    <li>employ designers or managers to bring in new ideas and working practices
                    </li>

                    <li>invest in new machinery and equipment to cope with improved processes
                    </li>

                    <li>find ways to reduce costs to become more competitive.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate=“*”>As change starts to take place, the organisation needs to measure progress, collect and evaluate
                    feedback, then amend action plans and activities to make sure that they ‘get there’.</p>

                <p data-animate=“*”>These principles work when planning change for a team as well.</p>
