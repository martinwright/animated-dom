                <h2 data-animate="2">Introduction</h2>

                <p>Organisations need to change for a wide variety of reasons. Some of them are internal reasons –
                    things going on within the organisation that need to be addressed. Some of them are external reasons
                    – things happening in the outside world that influence the organisation and prompt a need for
                    change.</p>

                <p>Some businesses only exist because they constantly strive to innovate and change, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>manufacturers of mobile telephones, tablets and electronic games
                    </li>

                    <li>television, theatre and film producers
                    </li>

                    <li>fashion designers and clothing manufacturers
                    </li>

                    <li>space and military engineering companies
                    </li>

                    <li>vehicle designers and manufacturers.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Not surprisingly, these businesses can be seen as exciting places to work as they are always looking
                    to innovate and find something new. When managed and supported properly, change leads to growth and
                    success for the individuals, teams and organisations involved. Organisations that fail to innovate
                    and change run the risk of losing out – eg on new business, good staff, customers, profit or market
                    share.</p>

            <section>

                <p>Several things can prompt the need for organisational change, including:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>changes in technology</strong><br>eg telecommunication companies adapting to new
                        generation mobile phones, tablets and other new devices
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>competitors’ activities</strong><br>eg airlines changing their routes, prices or level
                        of service to be able to compete with each other successfully
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>changes in the marketplace</strong><br>eg customers moving away from the high street and
                        making most of their purchases online or in out-of-town shopping centres
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>changing customer expectations</strong><br>eg hotel guests expecting a higher quality of
                        accommodation at low cost
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>new legislation, regulations or standards</strong><br>eg scrap metal companies having
                        new regulations about identifying their suppliers of metal (to reduce theft)
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>environmental factors</strong><br>eg new waste management procedures to reduce landfill
                        and contamination of the environment
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>financial issues</strong><br>eg rising costs making current processes unsustainable
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>political factors</strong><br>eg changes in government funding in education
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>internal business factors</strong><br>eg following a change in senior managers and other
                        decision-makers; as a business grows and increases its workload
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>external business factors</strong><br>eg fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Any of these causes of organisational change can affect teams and individuals, and managers need to
                    be aware of how they can lead, manage and support their team members.</p>

                <p>In this section, we are going to look at:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>basic principles of change management
                    </li>

                    <li>positive and negative impacts of change within a team
                    </li>

                    <li>techniques to support a team through change
                    </li>

                    <li>planning techniques and models for change
                    </li>

                    <li>examples of how to deal with negative impacts of change.
                    </li>
                </ul>
