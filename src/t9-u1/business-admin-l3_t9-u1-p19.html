                <h4 data-animate="2">4 The change curve</h4>

                <p>The change curve was developed in the 1960s by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross to explain the grieving process.
                    It has since been developed further to apply to change management, helping to explain people’s
                    reactions to major upheaval and change. It is a useful tool when managing individual or team change
                    as it helps managers to decide what level of support someone needs.</p>

                <p>It is based on three stages.</p>

                <strong>Stage 1</strong> – shock and denial</p>

                <p>Shock is often the first reaction to change, and can be caused by lack of information, fear of the
                    unknown, fear of looking stupid or doing something wrong. Shock can lead to decreased performance
                    and people needing more reassurance and guidance.</p>

                <p>It can be followed by denial, when people convince themselves that change is not happening or that it
                    will not affect them. They can feel threatened and afraid of failure.</p>

            <section>

                <strong>Stage 2</strong> – anger and depression</p>

                <p>Anger is often the next stage, and people try to find someone to blame – eg managers or the
                    organisation. Common feelings include suspicion, scepticism or frustration. When anger wears off, it
                    is frequently replaced by depression, which shows itself as apathy, isolation and remoteness.</p>

                <strong>Stage 3</strong> – acceptance and integration</p>

                <p>After the negative and difficult emotions in the first two stages, optimism and enthusiasm start to
                    return in the final stage. People accept that change is inevitable and begin to embrace exciting new
                    opportunities and feel relief that they have survived.</p>

                <p>Integration is the final step, when the main feelings are based on acceptance, hope and trust. It is
                    not uncommon to return to the previous stages if the level of support drops suddenly, so good
                    communication is critical to enable the optimism and enthusiasm to continue and develop.</p>

                <p>When supporting the team through a period of change, this theory helps managers to understand how the
                    negative emotions in the early stages usually lead to more positive emotions and enthusiasm. This
                    needs to be communicated to team members, so that they understand the process too and do not worry
                    too much about negative reactions.</p>
