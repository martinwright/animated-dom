                <h4 data-animate="2">1 ADKAR</h4>

                <p data-animate=“*”>This process was developed in 1999 by Prosci in the United States. It is an outcome-orientated model and is based on:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li><strong>Awareness</strong> &mdash; of the need for change. Individuals need to understand the need
                        for change, and planned communication is vital.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Desire</strong> &mdash; to participate in the change. Once fully aware of the reasons behind
                        the plans for change, individuals make a personal decision to support and participate. This is
                        done using incentives and creating a desire to be part of the change.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Knowledge</strong> &mdash; about how to change. This is the stage that involves learning and
                        development activities. These could be training courses, coaching sessions, mentoring,
                        discussion forums or other learning methods. Individuals need to know about the transition into
                        the new systems and how to operate once the new systems have become established.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Ability</strong> &mdash; to implement change. Individuals put the theory into practice. They
                        are supported with ongoing training, coaching and feedback sessions as they develop their new
                        skills and behaviours.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Reinforcement</strong> &mdash; to sustain the change. This stage makes sure that individuals
                        do not slip back into old ways so that change can be sustained. This is achieved through
                        positive feedback, rewards and incentives, and by measuring performance and adjusting when
                        necessary.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <img src="../images/_shapes/dec-s16.svg" />
                </figure>

            </section>

            <section>

                <figure class="shape-100" data-animate="2" style="position: relative; top:-1em; right:-1em; z-index: -2">
                    <img src="../images/t9-u1/_m_planning_techniques_01.jpg" />

                    <figure class="shape-15" data-animate="9" data-type="roll-from-right" style="opacity:.9; left:77%; bottom: -15%;">
                        <img src="../images/_shapes/pen-s8.svg" />
                    </figure>

                </figure>

                <p data-animate=“*”>The ADKAR model focuses on the individual and outcomes, rather than the tasks being performed. It is
                    flexible and can be used for big projects or individual development. It is considered better than
                    some models because it addresses the sustainability and reinforcement of change, something that is
                    neglected by many organisations that fail to bring about change in the long term.</p>

                <p data-animate=“*”>When supporting a team through change, managers can use this theory to plan their strategies to:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li>inform their team about the need for change
                    </li>

                    <li>gain team members’ desire to be part of the change
                    </li>

                    <li>give members information about the change
                    </li>

                    <li>make sure that they have the training, knowledge and ability to implement the change
                    </li>

                    <li>monitor performance and give feedback and praise once change has taken place.
                    </li>
                </ul>
