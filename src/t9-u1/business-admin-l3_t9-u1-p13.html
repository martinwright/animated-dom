                <p>Within the organisational structure, and to support the leadership skills of the manager, there need
                    to be processes to reward and recognise ideas and suggestions from the team. Team members and others
                    are more likely to participate and share their ideas if:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>they feel that they are being taken seriously
                    </li>

                    <li>credit is given to the appropriate individuals and teams
                    </li>

                    <li>ideas are praised, even if they are not fully used
                    </li>

                    <li>they are encouraged to think of even more ideas, and to keep an eye out for other opportunities
                        for development and improvement.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>People need to feel confident that their ideas will be valued. They need to feel secure and know that
                    their careers are not at risk if they voice concerns or come up with new and innovative ideas.</p>

                <p>Achieving an open and safe environment could include, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>a structure to channel ideas – eg workable ideas that come from mind-map exercises, spidergrams,
                        lists and brainstorming at team meetings, that the manager then takes to senior management
                    </li>

                    <li>suggestion boxes and incentive schemes – as an alternative route to the decision-makers
                    </li>

                    <li>organisational support of open discussions – eg to challenge assumptions, break old thought
                        patterns and consider new ideas
                    </li>

                    <li>procedures and policies to review problems from other perspectives – eg customer surveys, secret
                        shoppers, employee appraisals, social media and customer forums
                    </li>

                    <li>organisational support of innovation – to encourage people to create a positive atmosphere and
                        think of new ideas
                    </li>

                    <li>allowing time for the research and development of ideas.
                    </li>
                </ul>
