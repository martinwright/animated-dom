                <h4 data-animate="2">2 Negative impacts on individuals and teams</h4>

                <p data-animate=“*”><strong>Negative</strong> impacts on individuals and teams can include, for example:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li>uncertainty
                    </li>

                    <li>stress, worry and concern
                    </li>

                    <li>conflict within the team.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Uncertainty</h5>

                <p data-animate=“*”>People naturally worry about how changes will affect them – eg possible redundancy or staff changes
                    within the team. Dealing with bad news can often be easier than dealing with the ‘limbo land’ of
                    uncertainty. At least we know where we stand if we are given bad news and we can get on with
                    adjustment and looking for solutions. Not knowing the outcome of a planned objective just puts off
                    the pain, keeps false hope alive, and leaves the ‘what ifs’ hanging around for far too long. Delays
                    and lack of focus can cause debilitating stress for individuals, teams and organisations.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Stress, worry and concern</h5>

                <p data-animate=“*”>Team members can suffer from stress, worry and concern before, during and after a period of change.
                    For example, they may:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li><strong>feel inadequate</strong> &mdash; eg feeling unable to cope with new processes
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>fear losing control over their lives and environment</strong> &mdash; eg worrying about
                        having to relocate or lose their jobs if the employer talks about closing a branch or factory
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>feel threatened by the possible loss of skills or competence</strong> &mdash; eg automating a
                        factory in the manufacturing sector could lead to the downgrading of some jobs, plus possible
                        redundancies
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>feel uneasy if the workplace culture does not embrace change</strong> &mdash; eg the
                        philosophy is ‘the old ways are best’ or ‘we’ve always done it this way’
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>worry about rumours</strong> &mdash; eg if they hear about major changes or see stories in
                        the media before they have been told officially
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>feel their views do not count and that no one is listening to them</strong> &mdash; eg if
                        they are not given the opportunity to discuss options before major decisions are made
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>remember the failure or inadequacy of previous initiatives</strong> &mdash; eg failed
                        attempts to cut costs or speed up production times.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate=“*”>Stress and anxiety can have a serious impact on teams and can easily cause physical and mental health
                    problems – eg as a consequence of prolonged and high levels of stress and anxiety about changes.</p>
