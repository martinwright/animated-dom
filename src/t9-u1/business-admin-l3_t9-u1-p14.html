                <p>The number of effects on people and teams that can occur when making changes is infinite. This table
                    gives some examples of problems that are quite common, along with suggestions about how managers
                    might deal with the problems.</p>

                    <div class="cell">Give accurate information as soon as possible. Reassure them and be honest about
                        the action plan and how the changes will affect them. Give timescales about when more
                        information will be available. Involve staff members in planning and evaluation processes.
                        Provide confidential support and counselling

                    <div class="cell">Listen to feedback and review the initial research that identified the need for
                        change – amend as necessary. Amend the products, services or working methods to further improve
                        them. Find a different way of marketing products and services. Review working practices
                        regularly and look for ways to improve them. Communicate any changes and work hard to meet and
                        exceed expectations

                <p>Managers need to remember that employers have a legal obligation and must consult and agree changes
                    to existing employment contracts with employees. This means that they cannot simply change people’s
                    job roles, terms of employment or working conditions without consulting them first.</p>
