                <p>Lewin’s theory can be used for change management. Originally presented in 1947, the three elements of the model are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Unfreeze</strong><br>eg getting ready for change; understanding why change is necessary;
                        reducing forces that want to keep things the same; dismantling the current mindset; preparing
                        people to leave their current comfort zone.
                        Preparation can involve building in deadlines to reduce procrastination, focus attention and
                        increase motivation.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Transition or change</strong><br>eg developing new behaviours, skills, values, attitudes
                        or procedures. Lewin believed that change is a process, change or transition, not an event.
                        Support needs to be given, as people can be very scared and worried at this stage. This could be
                        in the form of training, coaching, role models or mentors, for example, and needs to be
                        reinforced by good communication.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Freeze or refreeze</strong><br>eg consolidating the changes; establishing stability once
                        the changes have been made; adapting to the new skills and developments.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>This model helps managers to have a broader overview of the change process. When supporting team
                    members, managers can prepare them for change, help them develop new skills and behaviours, then
                    consolidate the changes and establish stability.</p>

                <p>As Lewin said himself:</p>

                <p>'A change towards a higher level of group performance is frequently short-lived, after a "shot in the
                    arm", group life soon returns to the previous level. This indicates that it does not suffice to
                    define the objective of planned change in group performance as the reaching of a different level.
                    Permanency of the new level, or permanency for a desired period, should be included in the
                    objective'.</p>
