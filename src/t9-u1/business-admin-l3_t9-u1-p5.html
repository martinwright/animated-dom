                     alt=""

                <p>Effects of innovation and change can be positive or negative for team members.</p>

                <p><strong>Positive</strong> impacts for individuals and teams can include, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>improved career development opportunities and better job satisfaction
                    </li>

                    <li>better working practices and better job security
                    </li>

                    <li>reduced stress
                    </li>

                    <li>better teamwork.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Improved career development opportunities and job satisfaction</h5>

                <p>Change can present opportunities for team members to develop their careers and improve their job
                    satisfaction – eg chances to take courses in new skills that are needed; from redesigned job
                    descriptions, tasks and roles. The impact on the team generally can be better morale and higher
                    levels of achievement.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Better working practices and better job security</h5>

                <p>When the organisation improves and updates its working practices, it generally becomes more
                    efficient, competitive and profitable. Team members work to more modern standards that have been
                    redesigned as part of the change process, leading to better efficiency and improved job
                    security.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Reduced stress and conflict</h5>

                <p>Within the organisation or team, there can be a conflict of interest between different parts of the
                    workforce who want different things. Also, there can be stress when working practices and resources
                    need updating – eg when out of date machinery keeps breaking down or causes issues with quality;
                    when procedures and policies are no longer efficient or fit for purpose. Changes in the team’s
                    activities and working practices can upset people in the short term, however, stress levels and
                    conflicts of interest tend to reduce once everything has been explained and updated, and things have
                    settled down.</p>

                <h5 data-animate="2">Better teamwork</h5>

                <p>Better teamwork is often a result of a group of people coming through a successful period of change
                    together. The re-evaluation and reorganisation of team members’ tasks and resources can bring the
                    team together, with a new appreciation of what each person’s contribution is. There is also a sense
                    of shared pride from being a member of a successful and forward-thinking team or organisation.</p>
