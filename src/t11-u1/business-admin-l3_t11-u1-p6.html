                <img src="../images/t11-u1/setting_realistic_budgets_03.jpg"
                     alt=""

                <p>Budgets are needed to manage cash flow, control resources, plan for the future and secure financing.
                    They are needed so that an organisation can estimate its income and expenditure in the days, months
                    and years to come. This helps to make sure that there will be enough revenue to cover all
                    expenditure and leave enough money to make a profit.</p>

                <p>By making people accountable and responsible for a budget, an organisation can help to control its
                    resources. Working to a budget helps staff to understand organisational objectives and motivate them
                    to use resources efficiently and effectively.</p>

                <p>Budgets can also show how a business plans to allocate its resources for the future. If a business
                    wants to expand or make investments, it needs to know what its income and expenses are likely to be
                    before it commits to plans.</p>

                <p>For example, if a business wants to invest in new technology and buy a new, expensive, sophisticated
                    machine, it needs to prepare budgets to estimate:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>the capital cost of the new machine
                    </li>

                    <li>the running costs of the new machine
                    </li>

                    <li>the extra revenue that can be generated by using the new machine
                    </li>

                    <li>the potential savings in staff and maintenance costs from using a newer and more automated system
                    </li>

                    <li>how long it will take for the new machine to pay for itself
                    </li>

                    <li>the tax implications of investing in and operating the new machine.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Banks and other lenders will want to examine an organisationâ€™s budget before they agree to grant a
                    loan or overdraft facility. Similarly, if an organisation applies for credit from its suppliers, it
                    might be asked for a budget forecast so that they can negotiate discounts and payment terms based on
                    the likely level of business.</p>
