                <h4 data-animate="2">1 Key components of a budget</h4>

                <p>Budgets are estimates of income and expenditure for a set period of time. When setting realistic
                    budgets, managers need to look at:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>fixed costs</strong> &mdash; expenses that stay the same, regardless of sales rising or
                        falling – eg rent and insurance
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>variable costs</strong> &mdash; expenses that change according to sales volumes – eg raw
                        materials used to make the products
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>semi-variable costs</strong> &mdash; expenses that might be influenced by changes in sales –
                        eg salaries and advertising
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>income</strong> &mdash; and likely income.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>In addition, it is important to identify timescales, priorities and financial resources when
                    preparing a budget to ensure that everything is accounted for:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Timescales</strong> &mdash; to show when money is due to come in and out – eg when income is
                        due; when sales invoices are issued; how quickly customers pay; how quickly purchase invoices
                        need to be paid; deadlines for paying taxes.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Priorities</strong> &mdash; to target resources correctly to support the efficiency and
                        effectiveness of the organisation – eg prioritising workforce costs, essential purchases and
                        urgent capital investments.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Financial resources</strong> &mdash; to match funding with anticipated income and expenditure
                        – eg using an overdraft for short-term cash flow problems; financing long-term projects with
                        business loans; anticipated increases in sales revenue.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </section>

            <section>

                <p>There can be a main budget for the whole organisation, sometimes called the master budget, and there
                    can be several budgets within that for different departments or activities. For example, these could
                    all have their own budgets:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>sales and marketing department
                    </li>

                    <li>manufacturing and production department
                    </li>

                    <li>transport and packing department
                    </li>

                    <li>a project to update IT throughout the whole business.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Each department or project could have a budget that details the income it expects to bring in, and
                    what expenses it expects to have – eg stationery, transport, materials, payroll, building costs, or
                    one-off expenses for a specific project.</p>

                <p>Budgets can be done for any period of time that the organisation needs for its operations – eg daily,
                    weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, or for the period covered by particular projects or
                    activities.</p>

                <p>A budget for one item can appear in several places, and this can help provide a three-dimensional
                    picture of the organisation. For example, staff costs can appear in:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>each department’s own budget</strong> &mdash; to show the wage costs for their part of the
                        organisation
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>the HR department’s budget</strong> &mdash; to show the overall staff costs for the whole
                        organisation, which include training, recruitment, pensions, employment benefits and expenses,
                        management and HR costs as well as wage costs
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>budgets for a project</strong> &mdash; to show the estimated staff costs for that project
                        only.
                    </li>
                </ul>
