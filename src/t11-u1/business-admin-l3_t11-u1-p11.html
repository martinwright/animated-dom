                <p>Many internal and external factors can affect budgets and cause variance. Managers need to be able to
                    identify and respond to them to make sure that budgets and plans stay on track. Some issues will
                    come under the manager’s area of authority. Others need to be escalated so that the issues can be
                    addressed at an organisational level.</p>

                <p>The following table gives examples of factors and suggestions about how they might be addressed:</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="cell"><p>Inform relevant people</p>

                </div>

                <p>By monitoring input and output, a business can compare figures with the budgets and identify gaps
                    where money is going out faster than it is coming in. This enables them to close gaps. For example,
                    if a business sees in its budget that customers are paying for goods long after the business has
                    already paid for them, it can change its credit policy and make sure that customers pay sooner and
                    on time.</p>

                <p>Similarly, if a business has money on deposit or invested in assets, it needs to know the cash flow
                    requirements that are coming up so that it can move funds or sell assets at the right time, if
                    necessary.</p>

                <p>Managers need to monitor and review all aspects of operations and take quick action to address any
                    issues, variances and changes in forecasts that may affect budgets and plans for their team or
                    department. Early attention helps to keep objectives in line with the organisation’s goals and
                    budgets and minimise the impacts of changes.</p>
