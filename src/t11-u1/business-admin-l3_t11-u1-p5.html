                <h4 data-animate="2">2 Using information to set budgets</h4>

                <p data-animate=“*”>When developing a budget, it is often necessary to use estimations. This is because a budget is a
                    <strong>calculated guess or estimate</strong> and needs to have all of the expected figures in place. If something is
                    missing, it can put the whole budget out of balance and make it unrealistic and unreliable.</p>

                <p data-animate=“*”>Some of the estimated figures in a budget will be based on historical data – eg accounts from
                    previous years; a previous, similar project; research of competitors’ figures; projects run by a
                    previous employer.</p>

                <p data-animate=“*”>Some of the estimated figures will be based on current research and data – eg a range of prices found
                    on the Internet; similar current projects; competitors’ current charges; fixed costs that have
                    already been calculated; current sales and expenses.</p>

            </section>

            <section>

                <p data-animate=“*”>The remaining figures need to be based on educated and informed estimations, based on good knowledge
                    of the industry and marketplace, current trends, likely inflation, worldwide and domestic political
                    events, and any other relevant factors. Examples of estimations could include:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li>estimated revenue streams based on anticipated sales of a new product – to help calculate a
                        budget for new raw materials to make the next batch of the product
                    </li>

                    <li>an estimate of the number of people likely to buy tickets for an event – to help calculate
                        possible revenue from the project
                    </li>

                    <li>the estimated exchange rate between sterling and dollars in a year’s time – to help calculate
                        the value of future exports to the USA
                    </li>

                    <li>the estimated number of patients likely to use NHS accident and emergency services over the
                        winter – to help calculate the cost of agency staff who might need to be employed short term
                    </li>

                    <li>estimated birth rates in ten years’ time – to help to create a long-term budget for primary and
                        secondary schools
                    </li>

                    <li>estimates of the amount of stationery that is likely to be used by a department – to assist when
                        preparing the departmental budget for next year.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate=“*”>These estimations enable people to make reasonably well-informed, calculated guesses, estimates and
                    decisions about future activities.</p>
