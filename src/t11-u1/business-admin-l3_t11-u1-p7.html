                     alt=""

                <p>It is normal to have contingency plans to deal with unforeseen circumstances. Sometimes it is
                    impossible to budget exactly and managers can only estimate what may be needed to complete a
                    particular project or objective. When renovating a building, for instance, it is not possible to get
                    accurate costs for remedial work until some of the demolition has been done to reveal the inner
                    fabric of the building.</p>

                <p>Workplace and industry experience and risk assessments can help managers to estimate:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>what may go wrong</strong><br>eg machinery breakdown or severe weather
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>unknown costs</strong><br>eg changes in world prices of raw materials
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>possible extra costs and other consequences</strong><br>eg increased costs of raw
                        materials and delays in supplies and production
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>costs and delays when putting things right</strong><br>eg paying staff whilst waiting
                        for supplies; employing extra staff to catch up and achieve targets
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>steps that can be taken to mitigate the risk</strong><br>eg having more than one
                        supplier for key components
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>funds that need to be set aside</strong><br>eg a 20% contingency fund when building a
                        new factory to cover unforeseeable and variable costs.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>By planning for contingencies, managers can:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>incorporate the anticipated costs in their agreed budget</li>

                    <li>reallocate funds if necessary</li>

                    <li>have extra funds on standby in case they are needed</li>

                    <li>avoid extra delays because the planning has already been done</li>

                    <li>keep projects and progress of objectives on track.</li>

                </ul>
