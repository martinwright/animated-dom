                    data-animate="2">6 Arrange resources and support mechanisms to meet the objectives</h3>

                <img src="./images/t2/key_stages_06.jpg"
                     alt=""
                     style="width:80%;"
                     data-animate="3"/>

                <p data-animate="4">Resources and support mechanisms that suit your needs, objectives, circumstances and organisation need to be arranged. These include, for example:</p>

                <ul data-animate="5">
                    <li>development activities</li>
                    <li>support mechanisms</li>
                    <li>time and money.</li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="4"><strong>Personal development activities</strong> can be based on training or work-based experience. They can also be based on things that are done outside the workplace that develop skills that are used in the workplace. Generally speaking, development activities can include:</p>

                <ul data-animate="5">
                    <li>completing training courses – eg in the workplace, via distance learning or from local training providers</li>
                    <li>working in new areas within the organisation – eg in different departments or by doing simulation exercises</li>
                    <li>taking on new challenges and responsibilities at work – preferably whilst being supported</li>
                    <li>attending meetings, seminars and conferences that are not within the normal remit of responsibility</li>
                    <li>charity work – eg a finance department manager working in a charity shop to develop customer service skills</li>
                    <li>working as a volunteer in a different work sector – eg a catering manager volunteering to work in a hospice to improve communication skills</li>
                    <li>studying the organisation’s policies, procedures, operations and training materials to a deeper level</li>
                    <li>doing independent research to develop knowledge.</li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="4">It is worth being imaginative and making good use of the resources and networks of support that are available. Taking part in development activities outside the normal routine of work can be very stimulating, satisfying, rewarding and revealing, taking you into sectors and environments that you would not normally consider. You can be challenged to develop skills that you would not need or use for your current ‘day job’ that may become useful in the future.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">The <strong>support mechanisms</strong> that people need will vary, but it is important to plan them in advance wherever possible. Support can come from, for example:</p>

                <ul data-animate="5">
                    <li>your line manager – eg to arrange access to new experiences; to give permission for study time in work hours; to act as a mentor or coach</li>
                    <li>your organisation's HR and training departments – eg to help with access to courses; to access advice or counselling if there is a problem</li>
                    <li>an outside training provider – eg allocating a course tutor or assessor to guide you through a training programme</li>
                    <li>colleagues – eg to help with developmental activities or provide cover during study periods</li>
                    <li>family and friends – eg to give support at home during intense periods of study.</li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="4">It is also important to organise time and money before starting on a major programme of career development. Time management is critical and deadlines need to be managed so that ordinary activities can continue and still be productive. Finances may also need attention and preparation – eg to pay for fees yourself; to apply for funding via an employer; to arrange for funding via a training provider; to replace income if you have to work part time for a while.</p>
