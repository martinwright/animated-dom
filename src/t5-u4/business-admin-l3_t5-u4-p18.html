                <h5 data-animate="2">What is a partner relationship?</h5>

                <p>A partner relationship in the business context is one where two or more organisations come together
                    in order to offer a solution that is more complete for the customer than it would have been without
                    the partnership. This comprehensive solution means that not only does the customer benefit but so do
                    all the partners. Of course there is also the sharing of risk too.</p>

                <p>When two or more organisations come together in this way, often it is due to a longer-term
                    requirement to meet a business need. In complex partnership arrangements, the time and resource
                    needed to establish effective working relationships, communications and systems mean that
                    significant investment is likely, especially in the early days, to ensure that there is
                    standardising of work in key areas before going ahead with the arrangement.</p>
