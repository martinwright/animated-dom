                <p>We need to identify customers’ needs and expectations when we build relationships with them. The
                    facts we gather, especially at the beginning, form the foundations of the business relationship,
                    giving it direction and purpose. The details help us to manage expectations and focus on how we can
                    develop a long-term bond with people who are essential to our organisation.</p>

                <p>All customers have needs and expectations and generally want:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>efficient and polite service</strong><br>before, during and after buying or using a
                        product or service
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>good-quality products and services</strong><br>in line with the standards promised in
                        catalogues, brochures, websites, customer charters, company policies etc
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>complaints and problems to be dealt with</strong><br>politely and quickly, with an
                        effective outcome
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>their opinion and feedback to matter</strong><br>when dealing with staff, giving
                        feedback or discussing a problem.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Organisations work to identify their customers’ needs and expectations in several ways, including:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>using good questioning and listening techniques
                    </li>

                    <li>reviewing contracts and orders
                    </li>

                    <li>collecting and using feedback
                    </li>

                    <li>looking at sales and usage figures
                    </li>

                    <li>monitoring complaints
                    </li>

                    <li>arranging focus groups and market research.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Once the expectations and needs have been established, they need to be managed and developed. The
                    process of managing expectations does not mean that all expectations have to be met, especially if
                    they are unrealistic or unreasonable. It is important to take into account the organisation’s needs
                    and expectations during the process as well.</p>

                <p>Managing customers’ expectations broadly means:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>respecting each customer’s individual needs and expectations
                    </li>

                    <li>liaising with each customer to match their expectations with the right service offer for them
                    </li>

                    <li>suggesting or offering alternatives and compromises when needed
                    </li>

                    <li>keeping each customer informed at relevant stages
                    </li>

                    <li>keeping the organisation informed about any issues, so that changes can be discussed and implemented if necessary.
                    </li>
                </ul>
