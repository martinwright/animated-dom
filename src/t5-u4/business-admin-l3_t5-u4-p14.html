                <p>There are times when we need to tell customers that the organisation cannot meet expectations. This
                    can be due to delays or problems, or it can happen because the organisation simply does not offer
                    that particular product or service. To maintain a good customer relationship, we need to manage the
                    situation proactively and offer suitable alternatives. For example, our approach can be to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Apologise for the inconvenience</strong><br>the customer has come to the organisation in
                        the hope of getting the service or product that they want, so they need to be handled politely,
                        even if they are mistaken.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Explain why this cannot be offered and give information about what the organisation does
                        offer</strong><br>this reassures the customer and gives them information about the organisation
                        that can be useful in the future.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Offer alternatives if possible</strong><br>maybe offering an alternative product or
                        service that the organisation can provide, or suggesting other suppliers who can help the
                        customer.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Thank the customer for their enquiry and express a hope that the organisation can help
                        with other things</strong><br>this leaves a positive relationship experience and encourages the
                        customer to return in the future if a solution cannot be found immediately.
                    </li>
                </ul>
