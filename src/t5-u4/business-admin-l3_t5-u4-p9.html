               <h4 data-animate="2">2 The importance of customer relationships</h4>

                <div class="p-60">

                <p>Money does not always need to change hands directly between customers and the organisation for there
                    to be a business relationship. For example, patients at a hospital or service users who benefit from
                    a charity’s work still have a customer relationship, even though money is not charged at the point
                    of delivery. The relationship is valuable even if the financial aspect is small or non-existent.</p>

                <p>Whatever the customer service role or financial impact, developing relationships with customers is
                    important to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>promote or maintain customer loyalty</strong><br>eg making customers feel valued so that
                        they want to use a certain brand or service and recommend it to others
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>encourage or improve customer retention</strong><br>eg inspiring customers to stay with
                        the organisation because they receive a good service
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>encourage referrals</strong><br>eg giving customers incentives and the confidence to
                        introduce their friends, family and other contacts
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>maintain or increase revenue</strong><br>eg developing repeat business to secure future
                        sales and job security
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>improve and maintain high levels of customer satisfaction</strong><br>eg to reduce the
                        number of complaints and rejected goods
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>maintain and improve an organisation’s reputation</strong><br>eg portraying a good image
                        of how an organisation treats and values its customers
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>create and maintain a competitive advantage</strong><br>eg delivering better products
                        and services than competitors
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>enhance links with internal customers</strong><br>eg delivering good-quality support and
                        services to other work teams within the organisation.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Retaining customers and encouraging them to remain loyal is critical to long-term planning and
                    development for the organisation. If customers do not feel loyal towards an organisation, they are
                    far more likely to take their business elsewhere.</p>

                <p>As the saying goes, 'If you don’t look after your customers, someone else will'.</p>

                <p>By creating an emotional bond and a valuable relationship with each customer, an organisation can
                    help its customers to feel satisfied with their service offer and inspired to return to them in the
                    future. Loyal customers are also far more likely to recommend an organisation or brand to their
                    contacts.</p>
