                <p>Complaints can arise for a variety of reasons, including:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>poor quality or faulty products
                    </li>

                    <li>incorrect or incomplete delivery of items
                    </li>

                    <li>bad service – eg from rude or unhelpful staff
                    </li>

                    <li>the service or product does not match the description – not meeting the customer’s expectations
                    </li>

                    <li>delays and missed deadlines – maybe leading to fines and interest charges
                    </li>

                    <li>lack of information – eg when transport is delayed
                    </li>

                    <li>inefficient systems – eg call centres passing customers from one adviser to another when they
                        call for help; long queues that are badly managed.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>When dealing with complaints, it is essential to handle the situation well so that the customer
                    relationship can recover and move forward again. For example, we need to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>listen to or read the details of the complaint</strong><br>making notes about the
                        complaint
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>apologise to the customer</strong><br>and show that we understand and sympathise with
                        the customer
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>explain the background to the problem or issue</strong><br>or offer to investigate if
                        the cause of the problem is not obvious
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>keep the customer informed at all stages of the process</strong><br>even if it takes
                        many weeks to resolve the problem
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>apologise again</strong><br>reassure and thank the customer for their patience and
                        custom.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The <strong>HEAT</strong> method can be useful:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hear</strong><br>listening to the customer’s complaint properly.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Empathise</strong><br>showing that we understand the customer’s position, frustration
                        etc.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Apologise</strong><br>saying sorry is incredibly important.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Take ownership</strong><br>taking the problem seriously, seeing it through to a
                        satisfactory end, keeping the customer informed, passing on feedback to the organisation.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Complaints need to be dealt with quickly and effectively to defuse the anxiety and stop the complaint
                    becoming more serious.</p>

                <p>When dealing with complaints, we need to be aware of potential communication problems.</p>

                <p>For example, the customer may be anxious and a little aggressive due to being nervous about making
                    the complaint. They may also have visual, speech, reading, writing or hearing problems, or not have
                    English as their first language. It is important to take these factors into account when responding,
                    to keep the anxiety levels as low as possible and maintain good working relations.</p>
