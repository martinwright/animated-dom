                     alt=""

                     data-animate="6"/>

                <p>A stakeholder analysis is a useful tool as it helps us to see the people who will affect and
                    influence a project, and those who will be influenced by it. The analysis helps managers to tailor
                    their approach to get the most out of each relationship.</p>

                <p>The first step is to work out who stakeholders are, usually during a brainstorming or mind-mapping
                    session. They can be, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>line managers</li>

                    <li>team members</li>

                    <li>colleagues in other departments and teams</li>

                    <li>customers and potential customers</li>

                    <li>shareholders and owners of the organisation</li>

                    <li>suppliers and manufacturers</li>

                    <li>media contacts</li>

                    <li>government departments and agencies</li>

                    <li>lenders and other financial consultants</li>

                    <li>analysts and other outside professionals</li>

                    <li>the general public and local community</li>

                    <li>family and friends.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The second step is to prioritise the stakeholders and work out who has the most influence over a
                    particular project or objective. This enables us to target our attention and tailor our approach.
                    For example, if we need to find and develop our customer base, the main stakeholders who can
                    influence the outcome may include established customers, potential customers, media contacts and our
                    colleagues in the sales and marketing department.</p>

                <p>The third step is to get to know the relevant stakeholders, so that we know exactly how to target our
                    approach. For example, we need to find out about their motivation, plans, values, contacts and
                    objectives. This step also helps us to identify the stakeholders who may have a negative effect on
                    us or our project â€“ eg those who have a conflict of interest or want to undermine others.</p>
