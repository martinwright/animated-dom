                <h4 data-animate="2">2 Communicating with stakeholders</h4>

                <div class="p-60">

                <p>As with all business relationships, good communication skills are essential when building and
                    managing relationships with stakeholders. Well-chosen questioning and listening techniques, body
                    language, emotional intelligence and good writing skills help managers to communicate
                    effectively.</p>

                <p>Assertiveness, tone of voice, posture and the language used also need to be adapted to suit each
                    situation as the manager’s role in each relationship can vary. Their approach may be different when
                    dealing with, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>team members</strong> &mdash; the manager may have more of a leadership role, be more
                        assertive and confident, and use work-based jargon
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>established customers</strong> &mdash; the manager probably needs to be relaxed,
                        well-informed and confident and treat the customers as equals
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>potential customers</strong> &mdash; good questioning and listening skills are needed to
                        learn about their needs and expectations, and a quieter approach may be required
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>senior managers and directors</strong> &mdash; the manager needs to be seen as being
                        trustworthy, capable and aware of the influence of the more senior staff, and confident but not
                        too assertive
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>media</strong> &mdash; as a spokesperson for the organisation, the manager usually needs to
                        be friendly, approachable, extremely knowledgeable and well-briefed, and avoid the use of jargon
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>lenders and other outside professionals</strong> &mdash; the manager needs to be confident
                        and well-prepared, to show that they understand the stakeholders’ influence and knowledge of the
                        subject, and use appropriate language and posture.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The communication skills used with customers are also important when dealing with stakeholders.
                    Effective communication skills enable us to, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>influence decision making</strong> &mdash; eg by showing knowledge and confidence when
                        pitching for finance or support
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>establish trust and build a rapport</strong> &mdash; eg by demonstrating good speaking and
                        listening skills when handling queries and problems effectively in the boardroom
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>maintain engagement</strong> &mdash; eg by being consistent and confident and able to see
                        beyond immediate problems and setbacks when negotiating with local residents and councillors
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>solve problems</strong> &mdash; eg by showing good negotiation skills to find a compromise or
                        win-win solution when agreeing tough objectives with team members
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>maintain good records that help with management</strong> &mdash; eg by keeping track of
                        progress in a format that can be understood and appreciated by the stakeholders.
                    </li>
                </ul>
