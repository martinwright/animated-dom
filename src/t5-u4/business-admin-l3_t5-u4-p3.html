                <p>In this section, we are going to look at approaches to customer, partner and stakeholder relationship management. We will consider:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>underpinning skills required for business relationships</li>

                    <li>the importance of customer, partner and stakeholder relationships</li>

                    <li>stakeholder mapping</li>

                    <li>building effective business relationships</li>

                    <li>approaches to effective networking</li>

                    <li>creating an environment of trust and respect</li>

                    <li>influence and persuasion.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Organisations and individuals have business relationships with many different people and agencies.
                    They can be customers, partners or other stakeholders.</p>

                <p>Traditionally we think of <strong>customers</strong> as people who buy products or services from a
                    shop or business. However, customers can be <strong>internal</strong> (other teams and departments
                    within the organisation) or <strong>external</strong> (individuals or organisations outside the
                    organisation).</p>

                <p>The term <strong>partner</strong> in the context of being a business partner usually refers to a
                    professional relationship between two or more organisations whereby each party brings something to
                    the partnership. This relationship is often long term and the partnering organisations will share
                    both the rewards and the risks between or among them.</p>

                <p>The term <strong>stakeholders</strong> refers to anyone who has an interest or concern in the
                    organisation and its activities. They can include employees, suppliers, shareholders, government
                    agencies, contractors, local residents and customers. Stakeholders are affected by decisions made by
                    the organisation, so it is important to have good business relationships with them.</p>
