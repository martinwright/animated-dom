                <p>A stakeholder is any person, group or organisation that has an interest in a project or activity. Some stakeholder relationships are straightforward and are with people that we work with regularly or every day – eg team members or line managers.</p>

                <p>Some stakeholder relationships are more irregular and complicated, especially when different stakeholders are brought together for a project. Relationships can be sensitive and difficult as we rely on stakeholders to use their influence to help achieve objectives – eg approaching lenders for finance; liaising with residents about a proposed housing estate in their area.</p>

                <p>Building relationships with stakeholders can be quite challenging and there can be many variables. For example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>the relationship might be formal or informal</li>

                    <li>the manager might need to take a leadership role with some stakeholders, and a subservient role with others</li>

                    <li>stakeholders may be directly involved with the organisation, or have no connection at all</li>

                    <li>they might influence the decision-making process or only be affected by the decisions.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>When building and managing stakeholder relationships, it is important to, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>prepare a stakeholder analysis – to identify stakeholders and their expectations, needs and influence</li>

                    <li>communicate with stakeholders</li>

                    <li>negotiate and influence stakeholders.</li>
                </ul>
