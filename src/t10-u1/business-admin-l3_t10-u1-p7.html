                <p>The main objectives of any organisation in the public sector is to provide efficient and effective
                    public services, whilst carrying out government policy and complying with legislation. As they are
                    funded with public taxes, they must provide the best value for money services. Usually, an
                    organisation’s aim is stated in its mission statement. Private sector organisations usually focus on
                    the customer. Public sector organisations usually concentrate on the service they offer. Look at the
                    following mission statements:</p>

                <div class="table--t10-u1-7">
                    <div class="cell">Effective Care, Well Delivered</div>
                    <div class="cell">NHS</div>

                    <div class="cell">To improve public safety through prevention, protection and response.</div>
                    <div class="cell">Avon Fire Service</div>

                    <div class="cell">The Department for Work and Pensions exists to promote <strong>opportunity and
                        independence for all</strong>. We provide help to individuals and support the country’s economic
                        growth and social cohesion.<br>
                        The Department <strong>helps individuals</strong> to achieve their potential through employment,
                        to provide for themselves, their children and their future retirement. We work with others to
                        combat <strong>poverty</strong>, both of aspiration and outcome.
                    </div>

                </div>

                <p>Ultimately, a public sector organisation must provide a service to the general public as directed by
                    the central government department that determines the overall policy that organisations must work
                    to, eg health policy is determined by central government and interpreted and implemented by the
                    National Health Service. Therefore, if the central government policy is to make cuts, then local
                    organisations will be forced to streamline their operations to comply. This is particularly
                    noticeable in the area of education, where different governments have brought in different policy
                    on, eg the curriculum or the minimum age for leaving education and training. The schools and
                    training providers at the bottom of the structure must then implement this policy.</p>
