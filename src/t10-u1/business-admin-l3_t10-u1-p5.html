                <h4>2 The public sector</h4>

                <p>Within the public sector there are many different types of organisations of varying sizes,
                    serving many different purposes and many different customers. The one thing they do have in
                    common is that they are all funded, directly or indirectly, by public taxes and answer in
                    one way or another to Parliament or central government.</p>

                <p>Central government is organised into departments. These are much larger than what we
                    traditionally understand as a department within an organisation. Some will be as large as
                    a whole organisation; some will cover the UK as a whole and some only one or some of the
                    countries that make up the UK. Broadly, public sector organisations fall into: those
                    reporting to government departments, which are headed up by ministers of the political
                    party in power, and those reporting to non-ministerial government departments that answer
                    to Parliament rather than a cabinet minister, eg Ofsted, HMRC, Charity Commission. Major
                    changes in government policy, eg through a change of government, may affect the structure
                    of departments but not necessarily their functions. The departments work with local
                    authorities, non-departmental public bodies and other government-sponsored organisations.</p>

                <p>Public sector organisations include:</p>


                <ul>
                    <li>government departments, eg Department of Health</li>

                    <li>executive agencies with a specific function, that operate as discrete entities within the
                        government departments, eg The Met Office and HM Land Registry are both executive agencies
                        within the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS)
                    </li>

                    <li>non-ministerial departments are those that are not headed by a government minister, but
                        rather are controlled by legislation, eg the Foods Standards Agency
                    </li>

                    <li>non-departmental public bodies (NDPB) – sometimes called quangos – are groups set up to carry
                        out a specific task outside the government department; they may simply advise on areas of
                        policy (advisory NDPB), eg The Boundary Commission for England, or actually carry out a
                        specific service (executive NDPB), eg The Health and Safety Executive
                    </li>

                    <li>local authorities (councils), eg London Borough of Ealing.</li>
                </ul>
