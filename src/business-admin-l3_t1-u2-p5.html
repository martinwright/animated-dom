                <p data-animate="4">There are many psychometric tests available and it is easy to find them online. They are designed to show, for example, someone’s personality, mental ability, opinions, strengths, weaknesses and preferences. They are often used by employers, or prospective employers, so see how an individual’s own mix of natural skills and attributes will fit into what the organisation wants.</p>

                <p data-animate="5">They can be used as a recruitment selection tool by employers, but they are also useful when developing self-awareness skills. They help to unmask our hidden qualities and habits, and focus on our natural abilities and preferences.</p>

                <p data-animate="6">One well-known test is the <strong>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</strong> (MBTI) which uses the theory of psychological types described by Carl Jung. There are many free versions of it available online and it is well worth doing. When answering the questions, the answers are not easy to predict and we end up with an in-depth and revealing description of our personality. Our personality type is discussed, along with our strengths, weaknesses and preferences for work and learning.</p>

                <p data-animate="7">Doing a psychometric test ourselves helps us to appreciate that there are many different personality types within a successful team. We can see that a balance of attributes is needed and that no one personality type can thrive on its own in an effective organisation.</p>

                <p data-animate="8">One MBTI test can be found <a href="">here</a>.</p>

                <p data-animate="9">Another test is known as the <strong>Implicit Association Test</strong> (IAT). It measures non-conscious perceptions and associations that people have. Harvard University, USA, have a range of free tests online that analyse our unconscious bias.</p>

                <p data-animate="10">The Harvard IAT can be found <a href="">here</a>.</p>
