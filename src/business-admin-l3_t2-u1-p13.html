                    data-animate="2">7 Monitor progress and overcome barriers to learning</h3>

                <img src="./images/t2/key_stages_07.jpg"
                     alt=""

                <p data-animate="4">SMART targets help us to monitor progress against the objectives mapped out in the PDP.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">Progress needs to be monitored so that you can, for example:</p>

                <ul data-animate="5">
                    <li>assess progress against <strong>specific</strong> targets – to <strong>measure</strong> development – eg looking at dates for handing in assignments and seeing if they are on time</li>
                    <li>adjust elements of objectives – to keep them <strong>achievable</strong> and <strong>realistic</strong> – eg changing timescales following illness</li>
                    <li>allocate or seek additional resources – eg arranging for one-to-one tuition to learn a language needed for work on <strong>time</strong> for a newly signed project</li>
                    <li>agree further development activities – eg work tasks have been done early and there is scope to help out in a different department for a few days to learn new skills.</li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="4">The PDP needs to be monitored regularly with your line manager, to keep things on track so that problems do not get out of hand. If everything is going well, you will receive positive feedback which will be a boost and help to motivate you to carry on. If there are problems, it is vital to catch them early so that they can be dealt with quickly and keep the rest of the PDP intact.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">Monitoring can be quite informal because it is really keeping an eye on the smaller elements and details of the PDP.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">There can be <strong>barriers to learning</strong> that can stop people engaging in learning and career development activities. You need to identify potential barriers, or threats to progress, and do what you can to reduce these.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">Potential barriers to learning, and some suggested ways to overcome these barriers, include, for example:</p>

                <div class="table--fr4-fr8">
                    <div class="cell"><h3>Potential barrier to learning</h3></div>
                    <div class="cell"><h3>Suggested ways to overcome the barrier</h3></div>

                    <div class="cell">Lack of time</div>
                    <div class="cell">
                        <p>Work out exactly how much time will be needed and agree realistic goals</p>
                        <p>Discuss doing some study during working hours</p>
                        <p>Arrange cover when the individual is in college or doing internal courses</p>
                        <p>Create development activities that can be done on the job during normal hours</p>
                        <p>Arrange to do part-time courses over a longer period</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="cell">Lack of confidence</div>
                    <div class="cell">
                        <p>Have one-to-one meetings with a mentor or coach (maybe the line manager) to identify the causes of lack of confidence</p>
                            <p>Seek positive feedback to reinforce the positive aspects of performance, skills etc</p>
                            <p>Find small learning and development activities to build confidence – eg several short courses and seminars rather than a nine-month diploma course</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="cell">Fear about standing out from colleagues</div>
                    <div class="cell">
                        <p>Use positive feedback to reinforce the positive aspects of performance, skills etc</p>
                            <p>Check how well performance measures up against the organisation’s standards and expectations</p>
                            <p>Encourage team spirit and mutual support between individual team members</p>
                            <p>Watch for any bullying or harassment from other team members – act as required</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="cell">Worrying about being overworked or overloaded</div>
                    <div class="cell"><p>Develop time-management skills</p>
                        <p>Examine the current and expected workload and check that timescales are realistic</p>
                        <p>Make sure that the workload is fair and arrange for extra assistance or cover from others if necessary</p>
                        <p>Do not worry if it is necessary to step back and take a break</p></div>

                    <div class="cell">Learning styles are incompatible</div>
                    <div class="cell">
                        <p>Consider changing the development activities – eg introduce new activities; appoint different tutors; use different formats to appeal to different learning styles</p>
                            <p>Make sure that the content is relevant to the individual and the organisation
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="cell">Fear of change – eg in technology</div>
                    <div class="cell"><p>Review the benefits of change, job security, the future of the company etc</p>
                        <p>Find out about all aspects of the plans for change</p>
                        <p>Ask to be kept informed, and keep others informed</p>
                        <p>Have one-to-one discussions with the mentor/coach/line manager to identify causes of fear and ask for appropriate reassurance and support
                    </p></div>
