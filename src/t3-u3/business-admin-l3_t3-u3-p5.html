                <p data-animate="4">In comparison social media has many sources and many receivers. It is an active form of media and everyone can be both a source and a receiver. Again, there are a number of key features of social media:</p>

                <ul data-animate="5">
                    <li><strong>User-generated content</strong><br>anyone using social media can post content, making it two-way communication.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bottom-up</strong><br>social media allows those who were traditionally the receivers of information to generate information. There are several instances of high social media activity forcing traditional media broadcasters to take an interest in previously unreported crimes and trials. In situations of emergency or chaos, bottom-up reporting via social media has succeeded where traditional media sources have failed to provide enough information quickly enough (eg during the floods in the Balkans in September 2014).</li>
                    <li><strong>Unstructured</strong><br> messages are based on individualsâ€™ opinions rather than any controlled bias. Traditional broadcasters may slant their messages according to their purpose.</li>
                </ul>
