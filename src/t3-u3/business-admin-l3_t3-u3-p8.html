                    <li><strong>Making friends and forming relationships</strong> &mdash; it is quick and easy to make contact with others which may extend beyond virtual friendships.</li>
                    <li><strong>Finding a job</strong> &mdash; professional networking sites allow you to provide a resumé of your skills and experience and notify you of potential employment opportunities. Others who know you professionally can endorse your skills.</li>
                    <li><strong>Staying in contact with friends and family</strong> &mdash; our lives have become time-poor and few people have time to keep in touch with friends by telephone; social network sites provide a quick way of maintaining contact wherever those friends are in the world.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sharing photos</strong> &mdash; allowing friends to view and download photos – these might be of products they have recently purchased.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recouping lost contacts</strong> &mdash; with around 70% of the adult population having a social network profile, it is easy to find old friends you have lost contact with and quickly catch up on what they have been up to.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exchanging news and information</strong> &mdash; by sharing posts, there is rapid dissemination of news and information which can be used to promote new products and offers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Asking for help</strong> &mdash; it is easy to ask your group of friends for advice or help, for example, if you are looking to find a new flatmate or source a recommendation for a product or service.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fund-raising</strong> &mdash; posted and shared clips of videos showing friends performing amusing actions have been highly successful in raising money for charities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advertising</strong> &mdash; it is relatively cost-effective for organisations to purchase advertising space on social media sites and popular adverts are shared widely which promotes recommendations and reaches a wider audience and potential new customer bases.</li>
