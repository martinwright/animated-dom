                <ul data-animate="5">
                    <li>enable communication between line managers, colleagues and potential job applicants</li>
                    <li>promote and control organisationsâ€™ reputations.</li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="4">Social media can affect how colleagues treat one another and sometimes, due to accessibility 24/7, it can distort the boundaries between home and work.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">Your employer may have a policy governing the personal use of IT equipment which states clearly what you are allowed to do and what you cannot do. If you have any questions, speak to your supervisor or line manager.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">Some employers define the periods of the working day (for example during lunch breaks) when you can use the Internet for personal reasons. Others have a more flexible approach as long as the time taken is made up overall. This will depend on the organisational culture and management style in your workplace.  </p>

                <p data-animate="4">Employers also have different approaches to the use of work email addresses for registering with social media sites. Generally unless social media updates on behalf of an organisation are part of your work responsibilities it is better to use personal email addresses.</p>
