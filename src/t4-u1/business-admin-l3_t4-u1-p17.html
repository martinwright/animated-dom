We can have set times for dealing with these, and not let them disturb us when we need to focus and concentrate without interruptions. Even if managers have a customer-facing role, they still need to have time when they are not available, so that they can catch up on other tasks and be proactive about objectives and plans.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">We also need to be careful of a growing trend of dealing with work emails and other messages during our time off. Many people spend hours each week dealing with emails before or after work. </p>

                <p data-animate="4">If this is a regular or ongoing occurrence, it is an indication that time management and a workload review are needed.</p>
