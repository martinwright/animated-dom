                <p data-animate="4">An important skill when developing our careers is time management. It is the process of arranging and controlling how we spend our time, in or out of work.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">A study in 2007 by Proudfoot Consulting covered 2,500 businesses over four years in 38 countries. They identified that wasted time costs UK businesses £80bn per year, which was equivalent to 7% of the gross domestic product (GDP) at the time, the total money generated by the UK.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">Their findings showed the causes of wasted time were:</p>

                <ul data-animate="5">
                    <li>inadequate workforce supervision – 30%</li>
                    <li>poor management planning – 30%</li>
                    <li>poor communication – 18%</li>
                    <li>IT problems, low morale and lack or mismatch of skills – 21%.</li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="4">It is very important to make the workforce as efficient as possible to maximise the organisation’s investment in human resources. A 7% increase in productivity and efficiency would be a significant improvement for many organisations.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">Effective time management at work can benefit individuals too, and can help workers at all levels to, for example:</p>

                <ul data-animate="5">
                    <li>cut out non-essential activities</li>
                    <li>be more productive and achieve more within work hours</li>
                    <li>enhance career development prospects</li>
                    <li>make tasks more enjoyable and rewarding</li>
                    <li>meet deadlines more easily</li>
                    <li>achieve a better work-life balance.</li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="4">Many managers and team leaders have heavy workloads, considerable responsibility and big demands on their time and expertise. If time is not managed properly, these factors can lead to excessive strain and lack of performance.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">Effective time management can help managers to, for example:</p>

                <ul data-animate="5">
                    <li>be more organised on a day-to-day basis</li>
                    <li>be in control of upcoming projects and tasks</li>
                    <li>have a clearer view of their objectives in the short, medium and long term</li>
                    <li>maximise efficiency and productivity</li>
                    <li>enjoy better health as a result of lowering stress and anxiety.</li>
                </ul>
