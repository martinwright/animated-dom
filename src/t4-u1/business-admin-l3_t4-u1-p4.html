                <p data-animate="4">Workload planning requires forward thinking in order to make decisions. These decisions need to be based on information gathered about current and forthcoming work. The following are potential sources of information.</p>

                <p data-animate="4"><strong>Business and operational plans</strong> &mdash; provide an insight into activities scheduled to take place in the organisation, usually over a 12-month period. These will enable the manager to plan ahead and anticipate busier and quieter periods and develop a proactive plan for the workload.</p>

                <p data-animate="4"><strong>Project plans</strong> &mdash; the manager may be part of a team delivering a project, which is in addition to their normal work and routines. Having an understanding of the complexity of the project will provide valuable information when planning workload.</p>

            </section>

            <section>

                <p data-animate="4"><strong>Forecasts and budgets</strong> &mdash; provide a forward view and estimation of expected business activity. This information provides valuable insight into current and future workloads.</p>

                <p data-animate="4"><strong>Opportunities for delegation</strong> &mdash; having an understanding of the strengths and competencies of individuals in the team means that managers may have the opportunity to delegate work. Some people in the team may have strengths in areas the manager does not and will be more effective in completing certain tasks.</p>

                <p data-animate="4"><strong>Meeting schedules</strong> &mdash; knowing in advance what meetings are scheduled and the level of planning required will enable the manager to allocate sufficient time for this. Managers often have fixed meetings in their diaries and need to plan work around being able to attend these meetings.</p>

                <p data-animate="4"><strong>Personal goals and objectives</strong> &mdash; being clear about personal goals and objectives at work will help managers to understand key priorities for their own development and plan for them accordingly.</p>

                <p data-animate="4"><strong>Changes to external organisational conditions</strong> &mdash; certain external conditions such as changes in the political, social, economic and technological situation may well impact on an organisation. The manager needs to be aware of these external factors as they will provide insight into potential fluctuations in workload.</p>
