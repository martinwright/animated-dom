                <p data-animate="4">A key management function is to be able to plan. Plans often need to be adjusted as a result of unexpected changes, however strong planning provides everybody with a detailed understanding of what needs to be done, by whom and by when. This also applies to planning our workload.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">Therefore planning ahead helps to:</p>

                <ul data-animate="5">
                    <li><strong>Set direction</strong><br>starting in a clear and well-defined direction means that when changes do occur they are managed to maintain the progress to the agreed goal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Allocate resources</strong><br>means that people, time and budgets can be allocated to support necessary work and avoid any shortfalls.</li>
                    <li><strong>Manage risks</strong><br>careful planning will highlight any potential risks to work in the future allowing for contingency planning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Create certainty</strong><br>planning ahead will create a sense of certainty about what is to be done in order to achieve goals and objectives.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improve decision making</strong><br>knowing the direction aimed for provides a clear context to any decisions made in the future.</li>
                    <li><strong>Promote efficient working</strong><br>will highlight potential areas of waste and can therefore promote a more efficient approach to work that focuses on the key tasks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ensure tasks are prioritised</strong><br>tasks can be evaluated against the direction that has been set and then properly prioritised based on their level of importance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid diary and scheduling conflicts</strong><br>taking into account activities already in the diary means that new plans can be made to avoid conflicts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Support the delivery of projects</strong><br>often ‘one-off’ projects have to be integrated into normal operations – planning ahead will ensure that where projects have to be accommodated, this can be done without upsetting normal operations.</li>
