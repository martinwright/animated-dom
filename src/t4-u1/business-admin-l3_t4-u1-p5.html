                <img src="../images/t4-u1/different_approaches_01_c.jpg"
                     alt=""

                     data-animate="3"/>

                <h5 class="sub-heading"
                    data-animate="2">Informal approaches </h5>

                <p data-animate="4">Informal approaches can also be used to plan work activity. These include:</p>

                <ul data-animate="5">
                    <li>lists</li>
                    <li>informal conversations with the team and individual team members</li>
                    <li>personal diary schedules. </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="4">Some managers will create a daily work list extracted from an overall work and task list, some will prefer to plan weekly and others may use both methods. Lists can be stored either electronically or on paper and will depend on the preference of the manager and the work context they operate within.</p>

                <p data-animate="4"><strong>Lists</strong> – writing out lists of tasks is a good place to start any planning activity; however a straight list without any further detail lacks information about priority, deadlines and required resources. Also starting and ending with what might be a very long list of tasks could be both demoralising and demotivating.</p>

                <p data-animate="4"><strong>Informal conversations</strong> – short informal conversations with team members provide the opportunity for updates about current and future workloads across the team. These ‘check-ins’ help managers to quickly assess the potential effects on their own workload and whether any further planning is required.</p>

                <p data-animate="4"><strong>Personal diary schedules</strong> – managers will usually keep a diary system, some type of list and a plan of work to be done. These, together with some or all of the tools above, will help the manager to make the best decision about workload planning, based on the information to hand. </p>

                <h5 class="sub-heading"
                    data-animate="2">Formal approaches </h5>

                <p data-animate="4">If workload planning is to be reported on and used to monitor progress and performance then trackable tools will be required to allow for transparency and accountability. Examples include:</p>

                <ul data-animate="5">
                    <li>action plans</li>
                    <li>GANTT charts.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5 class="sub-heading"
                    data-animate="2">Action plans</h5>

                <p data-animate="4">These are essentially detailed planning lists that are reported against and updated to show progress. They allow for tasks to be described, planned and designated. In project management these are called work breakdown structures.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">This type of plan is created by capturing all the relevant tasks that need to be done by writing a list or by putting each individual task onto a separate note so that they can be worked with and moved around.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">Once all of the tasks have been listed we can see whether there are any tasks that are related. These can be put together to create either a combined task or a series of related tasks that can be dealt with more effectively and efficiently together.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">Tasks should be numbered to determine the order of priority and links with other tasks within the list. </p>

                <p data-animate="4">Once the tasks have been identified, they are entered into the plan and further description and detail is provided. This includes
                    <strong>estimating effort</strong> – when considering start and target dates for a task, a key consideration is the amount of time, or effort, it will take to complete the task from start to finish without interruption. We may estimate that a report will take eight hours in total to research and write. However, this is different to the actual duration. If, due to work pressures, the report is not able to be finished in one go it could be written at a rate of two hours per day over four days. </p>

                <p data-animate="4">The effort is eight hours but the duration is four days and this will be reflected in the start and target dates in the plan.</p>

                <h5 class="sub-heading"
                    data-animate="2">GANTT charts</h5>

                <p data-animate="4">When compared with an action plan, GANTT charts make accessing information quicker and easier for other readers, however they may not always have the same level of detail. A typical GANTT chart has the tasks listed on the left with a timeline across the top. This allows tasks and activities to be plotted along the chosen timeline. Weekly divisions have been used in the example below, but days or months could also be used if needed.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">Here is a simple example of planning over a four-week period:</p>

                <div class="table--t4-u1-5b">

                    <div class="cell"><h3>Task no.</h3></div>
                    <div class="cell"><h3>Week 1</h3></div>
                    <div class="cell"><h3>Week 2</h3></div>
                    <div class="cell"><h3>Week 3</h3></div>
                    <div class="cell"><h3>Week 4</h3></div>

                    <div class="cell">1. Write sales forecast</div>
                    <div class="cell"></div>
                    <div class="cell"></div>
                    <div class="cell"></div>
                    <div class="cell"></div>

                    <div class="cell">2. Present forecast to senior management</div>
                    <div class="cell"></div>
                    <div class="cell"></div>
                    <div class="cell"></div>
                    <div class="cell"></div>

                    <div class="cell">3. Write new business presentation</div>
                    <div class="cell"></div>
                    <div class="cell"></div>
                    <div class="cell"></div>
                    <div class="cell"></div>

                    <div class="cell">3.1. Deliver new business presentation</div>
                    <div class="cell"></div>
                    <div class="cell"></div>
                    <div class="cell"></div>
                    <div class="cell"></div>

                    <div class="cell">4. Monthly team meeting</div>
                    <div class="cell"></div>
                    <div class="cell"></div>
                    <div class="cell"></div>
                    <div class="cell"></div>

                    <div class="cell">5. Team member one-to-one meeting</div>
                    <div class="cell"></div>
                    <div class="cell"></div>
                    <div class="cell"></div>
                    <div class="cell"></div>

                </div>

                <p data-animate="4">GANTT charts have the advantage of offering a visual and more immediate view of the tasks and timeline. It is immediately clear that the manager needs to write a sales forecast in week one of the month and present it in week two. They also have a new business presentation to prepare in week three and deliver in week four. Over the course of the month they also need to deliver a team meeting and conduct one-to-one meetings throughout the month.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">An effective way to present workload planning with these two tools is to use them together. A detailed action plan is created first and the tasks and timelines are then used to create and inform a GANTT chart. The person carrying out the workload planning has the detail they need in the action plan but can make the plan visually accessible and report on it via the GANTT chart.
                    The approach a manager takes to workload planning depends on the situation; however, the use of lists and planning tools provides clarity and structure, ensuring that the important work gets done on time.</p>
