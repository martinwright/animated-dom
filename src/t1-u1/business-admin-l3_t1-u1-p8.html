                <p data-animate="*">A few points to consider when dealing with internal and external customers:</p>

                <ul data-animate="*">
                    <li>treat them with respect</li>
                    <li>honour any commitments</li>
                    <li>remember that you are part of a team even if the person concerned is not part of your immediate team – the organisation is a team</li>
                    <li>deal with requests politely, professionally and willingly</li>
                    <li>poor customer service can affect working relationships.</li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="*">First impressions count. If you get it wrong, you will have a disinterested customer.</p>

                <p data-animate="*">Excellent customer service starts with the way you greet customers. It is important to create a good first impression in your approach, communication and professionalism as the customer will form an impression of your organisation based on your performance.</p>

                <ul data-animate="*">
                    <li>Greet customers in a warm and friendly manner but don’t be over-friendly as you need to maintain your professionalism. </li>
                    <li>Your body language is as important as what you say and do. </li>
                    <li>Try to look (and feel) approachable and welcoming and then go on to establish what the customer's needs are.</li>
                </ul>

                <figure class="shape-10" data-animate="*" style="position:relative; opacity:.8; left: 60%; bottom: 0%;">

                    <img src="../images/t1-u1/_m_customer_service_10.jpg" />

                    <figure class="shape-30" data-animate="*" style="opacity:.8; left: 0%; bottom: -5%;">
                        <img src="../images/_shapes/cir-p4.svg" />
                    </figure>

                </figure>

                <p data-animate="*">It is important to have the right attitude to achieve customer satisfaction whilst also meeting the needs of your organisation. You can demonstrate your professionalism through:</p>

                <ul data-animate="10">
                    <li>the way you look</li>
                    <li>the way you communicate</li>
                    <li>the way you act</li>
                    <li>your knowledge of your products and services.</li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="11">Body language can signal pleasure, anger, frustration or aggression without the service deliverer realising it and can affect the behaviour of the customer who reacts to what they perceive the message to be and vice versa.</p>

                <p data-animate="12">This non-verbal communication should not be considered in isolation but should be considered along with the words being used. Both a service deliverer and customer convey messages through their body language which can impact dramatically on the outcome of the interaction.</p>
