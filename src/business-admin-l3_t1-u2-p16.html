                <img src="./images/t1/business_needs_objectives_book_02.jpg"
                     alt=""

                     data-animate="3"/>

                <p data-animate="4">In addition to our personal traits, we all have and hold values and beliefs that are important to us. When these are not aligned with the organisation’s values and beliefs, this can cause significant challenges in terms of motivation. Values and beliefs sit right at the root of what drives someone to operate and interact the way they do. Virtually everything people do is governed and regulated by their belief systems, their associated values and how they see themselves – their identity. Identity sits right at the core of what makes a person who they are. It incorporates all of their values, beliefs and accompanying characteristics, experience and perceptions.</p>

                <p data-animate="5">To help differentiate between values and beliefs ask:</p>

                <ul data-animate="6">
                    <li>‘Is this something I aspire to or that I aim to be like?'  – reveals a value.</li>
                    <li>‘Is this something I consider to be true and act accordingly?’ – reveals a belief.</li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="7">Beliefs are founded on our experience and help us make sense of the world. People pay attention to what they believe to be important and disregard things they consider to be unimportant. In this respect, beliefs act as filters. People's belief systems in the workplace are important to driving the success of the business, as it is beliefs that drive behaviour. Indeed, Henry Ford famously emphasised this in saying, ‘whether you believe you can or you believe you can't, you're probably right’.</p>
