                <h4 data-animate="2">1 Issues</h4>

                <p data-animate=“*”>An <strong>issue</strong> that affects a project, has <strong>actually happened</strong>. It is
                    something that is real and actually has an impact on the project. Despite every effort to minimise
                    risk, there are some things that cannot be mitigated and they do cause issues for the project team.
                </p>

                <p data-animate=“*”>If any one of the identified potential risks becomes a reality, it becomes an issue that the project
                    management team needs to address. Examples of issues that affect projects include, for example:</p>

                <ul data-animate="*">
                    <li><strong>weather</strong> &mdash; eg leading to cancellation or reorganisation of an event; leading to
                        increased costs from having to use extra resources to deal with the consequences
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>inability to recruit sufficient, good-quality team members</strong> &mdash; eg due to
                        insufficient local supply or competition from other organisations
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>illness or injury to team members or others</strong> &mdash; eg following an accident in the
                        workplace
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>increased prices of supplies</strong> &mdash; eg due to a change in world prices of raw
                        materials
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>decreased revenue</strong> &mdash; eg as a result of bad weather
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>political change</strong> &mdash; eg the UK deciding to leave the European Union.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <figure class="shape-50" data-animate="9" data-type="zoom-in" style="opacity:.6; left:-30%; top: -5%; z-index: -1">
                    <img src="../images/_shapes/dec-s13.svg" />
                </figure>

                <figure class="shape-110" data-animate="2" style="position: relative; right: 0; top:-1em; z-index: -1">

                    <img src="../images/t13-u3/project_risks_02.jpg" />

                    <figure class="shape-15" data-animate="9" style="opacity:.9; left:-6%; top: 20%;">
                        <img src="../images/_shapes/cir-s7.svg" />
                    </figure>

                </figure>

                <p data-animate=“*”>As risks and issues can both affect how a project is run, they need to be managed and tracked. The
                    project team need to do all that they can to minimise the risks of harm to the project, and to make
                    plans and forecasts about how they will deal with issues that do arise.</p>

                <p data-animate=“*”>The implications of failing to mitigate risks and plan how to deal with issues can be extremely
                    serious – from physical harm to people to the failure of the whole project or the organisation.</p>
