                <div class="p-60">

                <p>When managing issues, the project manager needs to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>understand the nature of the issue</strong>eg the reasons why recruitment of new
                        team members is so difficult, maybe using a PESTLE analysis (to look at political, economic,
                        social, technological, legal and environmental impacts)
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>evaluate the scope of the issue</strong>eg how big a problem this could be and how
                        the recruitment problem could either ease or get worse
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>evaluate the impact on the project</strong>eg how the recruitment problems could
                        cause extra work for current team members or complete failure of the whole project.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Doing a SWOT analysis as soon as an issue has been identified could be an effective activity to focus
                    attention and aid the decision-making process. By looking at the strengths, weaknesses,
                    opportunities and threats to progress of each possible solution, the project manager can evaluate
                    the issue and work out how to limit or eliminate the impact of the issue.</p>

                <p>For example, a project manager still needs another 50 stewards to run their event. They normally have
                    trained volunteer stewards. However, with only one month to go, they do not have enough people to
                    steward the event, and there is a legal requirement to have sufficient stewards on duty whenever the
                    public are in the venue. All stewards need to have a full day’s training if they do not hold a
                    current Spectator Security qualification. The project manager does a SWOT analysis to help them
                    identify the pros and cons of each option:</p>
