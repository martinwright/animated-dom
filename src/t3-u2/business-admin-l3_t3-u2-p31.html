                <p data-animate="4">Why do you have to follow data protection and security procedures when dealing with a telephone call?</p>

                <p data-animate="4">When dealing with customers on the telephone it is important that you follow the data protection policy. This is used to confirm, through a verification process, who you are talking with. This in turn can detect and prevent fraud from taking place. You should also keep your passwords or log-in details secure and do not share them with others. Passwords should be changed regularly, and you should not use ones that are easy to guess.</p>

                <h5 class="sub-heading"
                    data-animate="2">General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR)</h5>

                <p data-animate="4">The General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) are the European Union’s (EU) framework for data protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU. They replaced the UK’s Data Protection Act on 25 May 2018. These regulations have expanded the definition of ‘personal data’ to include information such as online identifiers (IP addresses) to reflect the changes in technology and the way organisations collect information about individuals.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">The GDPR provides the following rights for individuals:</p>

                <ol data-animate="5">
                    <li><strong>The right to be informed</strong><br>Organisations have an obligation to provide ‘fair processing information’ typically through the use of privacy notices. The GDPR sets out the information that organisations should supply and when individuals should be informed. The information supplied about the processing of personal data must be:
                        <ul>
                            <li>concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible</li>
                            <li>written in clear and plain language, particularly if addressed to a child; and free of charge.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>The right of access</strong><br>Under the GDPR, individuals will have the right to obtain:
                        <ul>
                            <li>confirmation that their data is being processed</li>
                            <li>access to their personal data</li>
                            <li>other supplementary information – this largely corresponds to the information that should be provided in a privacy notice.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>The right of rectification</strong><br>Individuals are entitled to have personal data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete.</li>
                    <li><strong>The right to erasure</strong><br>An individual can request the deletion or removal of personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing.</li>
                    <li><strong>The right to restrict processing</strong><br>Under the GDPR, individuals have a right to ‘block’ or suppress processing of personal data. When processing is restricted, organisations are permitted to store the personal data, but not to process it.</li>
                    <li><strong>The right to data portability</strong><br>Allows individuals to obtain and reuse their personal data for their own purposes across different services.</li>
                    <li><strong>The right to object</strong><br>Individuals have the right to object to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>processing based on legitimate interests or the performance of a task in the public interest/exercise of official authority (including profiling)</li>
                            <li>direct marketing (including profiling)</li>
                            <li>processing for purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Rights related to automated decision making including profiling</strong><br>The GDPR has been expanded to apply to all automated individual decision making and profiling. Organisations can only carry out this type of decision making where the decision is:
                        <ul>
                            <li>necessary for the entry into or performance of a contract</li>
                            <li>authorised by the EU or a member state's law applicable to the controller</li>
                            <li>based on the individual’s explicit consent.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                </ol>
