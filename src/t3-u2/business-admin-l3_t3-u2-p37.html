                <p data-animate="4">To get to know a person and their needs, use closed questions to get facts, open questions to learn more, and recall questions to build a history.</p>

                <p data-animate="4"><strong>OPEN</strong> questions tend to start with 'What …?', 'Why …?', 'When …?' or 'How …?'. They invite people to express and expand their answers as fully as possible, even into multiple answers. So, they’re great for opening up discussion, problem solving and critical thinking.</p>

                <p data-animate="4"><strong>CLOSED</strong> questions like, 'Have you sealed the valve?' or 'What is the person’s date of birth?' tend to get only one answer. So they’re best when you want to focus on something specific. For example, you might use closed questions to test knowledge like, 'Should you direct customers immediately to the website?'</p>

                <p data-animate="4">Closed questions are useful for simple responses that require a lower level of thought. Open questions result in longer, possibly more thoughtful responses and promote a higher level of thinking.</p>
