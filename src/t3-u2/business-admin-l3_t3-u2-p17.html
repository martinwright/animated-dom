                <h4 class="sub-heading"
                    data-animate="*">3 The skills of effective listening</h4>

                <p data-animate="*">Active listening will benefit from the following:</p>

                <ul data-animate="*">
                    <li>focusing on the needs of the other person</li>
                    <li>clearing the mind of distractions</li>
                    <li>avoiding assumptions and judgements</li>
                    <li>maintaining appropriate eye contact</li>
                    <li>nodding the head appropriately at what the other person is saying</li>
                    <li>building rapport through sitting opposite the other person in a similar way</li>
                    <li>making verbal noises ‘mmms’ and ‘ahhhs’ etc to acknowledge what is being said</li>
                    <li>asking short probing questions to encourage exploring a topic ‘tell me more about …’.</li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="*">It may feel odd at first and the other person may wonder what is happening! However most people will benefit from really being authentically listened to, it is a high-value activity.</p>

                <h5 class="sub-heading"
                    data-animate="*">Mirroring and matching </h5>

                <p data-animate="*">The technique of rapport building was discussed in <em>Different Forms and Techniques of Communication and their Application</em>. A way of developing this technique to not only support active listening, but to improve communication generally, is that of mirroring and matching. This is simply about gently reflecting back the body language, verbal language (words, tone and speed) and movements of the other person, not to mimic, but to create rapport. </p>

                </section>

            <section>

                <p data-animate="*">Consider when two people are in rapport whilst talking. They:</p>

                <ul data-animate="*">
                    <li>sit in similar positions</li>
                    <li>make similar hand gestures when talking</li>
                    <li>speak at similar speeds and volumes</li>
                    <li>use similar words</li>
                    <li>use similar amounts of eye contact. </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="*">We may already work with people with whom we naturally share this level of rapport. However, the techniques of mirroring and matching help us to build rapport and improve our communications with those we do not have an immediate natural rapport with.</p>

                <p data-animate="*">Doing so can create the opportunity for active and deeper listening. If we, through using mirroring and matching, can develop a deeper level of understanding and trust, a favourable climate for active and deeper listening is created.</p>

                <p data-animate="*">As mentioned above, this is not about copying or mimicking – this technique needs to be applied carefully and subtly and with self-awareness. If at any point the other person notices and thinks it is in any way false, and that you are just copying or mimicking, you will spoil the rapport.</p>

                <p data-animate="*">Mirroring is when two people are facing each other and one makes a gesture with their right  hand. The other person would make a similar gesture with their left hand in order to ‘mirror’ it. Matching means the other person would do the same gesture but with their right hand (to match as opposed to mirroring).</p>

                <h5 class="sub-heading"
                    data-animate="*">Reflecting and summarising</h5>

                <p data-animate="*">The techniques of reflecting and summarising can also help to both support and develop active and deeper listening. Reflecting back the words used by the person speaking can raise their awareness about the accuracy and quality of the words they use.</p>

                <p data-animate="*">People sometimes use words such as ‘never’, ‘always’, ‘everyone’ and ‘everything’ when talking about a problem. These words are known as universals. Reflecting or saying them back can have the benefit of challenging the accuracy of what was said. The person may be saying that ‘everything has gone wrong’ when in fact that is not the case at all.</p>

                <p data-animate="*">Summarising demonstrates the listener has an understanding of what has been said. This has the benefit of not only ensuring that the listener pays careful attention to what is being said, but also reassures the speaker that their situation is fully understood.</p>
