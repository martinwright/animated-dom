                <p data-animate=“*”>Projects usually have a beginning, a middle and an end once the idea has been put forward. For
                    example, an event management company’s new project is to run a charity concert for a client:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li>The initial idea is put forward and discussed.
                    </li>

                    <li>At the beginning of the project, the company’s tasks are linked to planning the event.
                    </li>

                    <li>In the middle of the project, the company runs the actual event.
                    </li>

                    <li>At the end of the project, the company works on feedback and evaluation about how the concert
                        went.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate=“*”>Using the charity concert as an example of a project, tasks for managers and their teams could
                    include, for example:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li><strong>researching and planning the project</strong> &ndash; eg finding a venue, booking performers
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>working out timescales</strong> &ndash; eg planning when things need to be delivered
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>finding and organising resources</strong> &ndash; eg extra staff to act as stewards on the
                        day; seating and catering at the venue; ordering portable toilets
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>sending out information about the concert</strong> &ndash; eg publicity materials to news
                        agencies and media; putting up posters; arranging TV, radio and press advertisements
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>contacting people coming to the event</strong> &ndash; eg sending invitations and tickets;
                        dealing with telephone and email queries
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>setting up the venue and supporting the organisers</strong> &ndash; eg providing
                        administration support and dealing with queries
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>helping to host guests and performers</strong> &ndash; eg arranging transport or giving
                        directions
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>supporting event staff after the concert</strong> &ndash; eg taking care of lost property;
                        taking unused programmes back to the office; dealing with queries
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>evaluating the success of the concert </strong> &ndash; eg reviewing ticket sales; responding
                        to feedback, complaints and comments; helping to sort receipts and analyse the costs.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate=“*”>The tasks are focused on the project and follow the plans and objectives of the project. They do not
                    form part of the regular, routine work of the organisation. Once the project is over, the tasks
                    cease.</p>

                <p data-animate=“*”>Working to timescales is critical. Things must be done on time as delays can have a knock-on effect
                    on other people and tasks connected with the project.</p>
