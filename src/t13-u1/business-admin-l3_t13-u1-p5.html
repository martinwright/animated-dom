                <h4 data-animate="2">1 Initiation</h4>

                <img src="../images/t13-u1/key_stages_01.jpg"
                     alt=""
                     style="width:100%;"
                     data-animate="6"/>

                <p>During the <strong>initiation</strong> stage, the <strong>purpose</strong> of the project needs to be
                    clarified before planning and preparation can take place. Working to an agreed purpose helps to
                    focus everyone involved with the project. It helps to stop them being distracted by side issues,
                    especially if the project becomes very intense and they are working under pressure.</p>

                <p>In our example, the agreed purpose of the charity concert is to raise funds for the charity.</p>

                <p>Before the planning gets fully underway, the decision-makers also need to agree the
                    <strong>scope</strong> of the project. The scope can be defined as a broad outline of what is needed
                    to achieve a satisfactory result. It is good practice to include details about what is not included
                    within the scope of the project, so that people can see the parameters clearly.</p>

                <p>In our example, the organisers need to agree, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>the size of the venue they think they can fill – eg a village hall that seats 100, a local
                        theatre that seats 600 or a large stadium that seats many thousands of people
                    </li>

                    <li>the level of entertainment they can afford and are able to organise – eg local youth bands and
                        entertainers or international, well-known rock bands
                    </li>

                    <li>what they can achieve with the resources they can access.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Individual members of the project team, especially the main decision-makers, need to agree the scope
                    of their particular role in the project – eg how much time and expertise they can contribute. They
                    will look carefully at the business case for the project – the planned outcomes, costs and benefits
                    to the organisation – and how the project fits into the activities, culture and objectives of the
                    organisation as a whole.</p>

                <p>The <strong>aims and objectives</strong> of the project all need to be agreed so that everyone
                    understands where they will be going with the project, and what they will have to do to make it a
                    success at every stage.</p>

                <p>In our example, the purpose of the charity concert is to raise money for the charity. The aim is to
                    run a concert that makes a decent profit that can be given to the charity. The objectives along the
                    way could include, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>raising the profile of the charity
                    </li>

                    <li>bringing attention to the charity’s work
                    </li>

                    <li>increasing the number of supporters
                    </li>

                    <li>giving the concert-goers a really good and memorable night
                    </li>

                    <li>career development for staff, by increasing their skills, knowledge and experience.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>All of this can be put together in a <strong>brief</strong> for the project team, along with <strong>terms
                    of reference</strong> to provide the basic structure for the planning stage.</p>
