                <p>Having spent a great deal of time and effort planning a project, there comes a time when the project
                    team needs to put all their theory and preparation into practice and deliver the project. This can
                    be an exciting and stressful time when everything is tested for real. Decision-making and
                    problem-solving skills are needed to deal with the inevitable queries and problems that could
                    threaten to alter the progress of the project.</p>

                <p>To keep things on track, progress needs to be <strong>monitored</strong> and
                    <strong>measured</strong> so that any potential problems are identified as soon as possible, maybe
                    against SMART targets, planners, flow charts, budgets and risk assessments.</p>

                <p>Monitoring and controlling a project can involve, for example, performing <strong>internal and
                    external audits</strong>. Larger projects may be audited by internal or external audits, especially
                    if the organisation is a limited company or a charity where there is a legal requirement to monitor
                    activities. Internal audits can be done by someone who works for the organisation – eg a manager.
                    External audits are carried out by people outside the organisation – eg registered accountants or
                    auditors.</p>

                <p>Regular <strong>progress reviews</strong> and team meetings during a project will help to identify
                    actual and potential problems as they arise. By reviewing flow charts, task lists, planners, project
                    plans, objectives and so on, the team can see the problems, and reprioritise and allocate resources
                    to deal with the issues.</p>
