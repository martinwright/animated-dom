                <p>When a project moves into its final phase, it is time to evaluate against the agreed aims and
                    objectives to see how it met and exceeded expectations. Projects need to be closed down and lessons
                    need to be learnt and recorded for future research and development.</p>

                <p>The review stage is extremely important as it gives people the chance to make notes, give and receive
                    feedback and record information for future projects whilst issues, problems and successes are still
                    fresh in the memory.</p>

                <p>Closure needs to be managed well so that, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>people who worked on the project feel valued and appreciated
                    </li>

                    <li>the clients or other decision-makers who authorised the project appreciate its value, see what
                        has been achieved and feel confident about commissioning further projects
                    </li>

                    <li>contacts made within the supply chain feel valued and are kept up to date
                    </li>

                    <li>all stakeholders can see the benefits and positive results of the project before they move onto
                        the next activity.
                    </li>
                </ul>
