                <p>By using management tools, the project manager can monitor progress and see when it is time to
                    implement the next stage of delivery of the project. For our example of the volunteers working at
                    the charity concert, the sequence might include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>establishing the uniform sizes needed for the new recruits
                    </li>

                    <li>giving a provisional order to the supplier – so that they can start to prepare
                    </li>

                    <li>finishing recruitment of volunteers
                    </li>

                    <li>confirming the uniform sizes that are needed and making the final order a month before the
                        concert – the company needs two weeks to print and deliver the uniforms.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Until the volunteer recruitment has been finalised, it is not possible to make the final uniform
                    order. As a contingency, a few extras of the standard sizes will be ordered. By tracking all of this
                    information using, for example, a PERT diagram or a Gantt chart, the project manager can identify
                    critical points and make sure that everything is on track.</p>

                <p>Using the project management tools we mentioned before, here are some suggestions about how they
                    might be used to monitor progress in the recruitment and training of team members in our charity
                    concert example:</p>

                    <div class="cell"><h4>SWOT analysis</h4></div>
                    <div class="cell">To track the strengths and weaknesses of recruitment policies compared to expected

                    <div class="cell">To have a visual record of how a delay in advertising vacancies has a knock-on

                    <div class="cell"><h4>Gantt charts</h4></div>
                    <div class="cell">To see how the recruitment and training elements of the project are progressing in
                        relation to all other aspects of the project, such as physical resources and finance
                    </div>

                    <div class="cell"><h4>Plan on a page</h4></div>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Another useful tool to use when monitoring a project’s progress is to show the
                    <strong>RAG</strong>status – <strong>red, amber, green</strong>. During the planning stage, the
                    planning team can set parameters about what the colours mean, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Red</strong><br>major problems that will affect the viability of the whole project and
                        cannot be resolved by the project manager – the matter should be escalated to the project board
                        member.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Amber</strong><br>problems that have a negative effect on one or more aspects of the
                        project’s viability and performance – problems can be dealt with by the project manager and
                        their team, who then notify the board about progress.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Green</strong><br>the project is performing to plan – all problems are within tolerances
                        and expectations and can be dealt with within normal limits of authority.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>There can be drawbacks to the traffic-light system; it can oversimplify a project’s progress and it
                    is very dependent on the integrity of the information that can turn an element from red to amber or
                    green. As a visual aid, it is effective as it draws attention to the problem areas and shows when
                    everything is on track.</p>

                <p>It can really help to keep everyone involved and motivated by letting them know how things are going.
                    If the news is not very good, it can help to reassure everyone, so that they work harder to get back
                    on track and understand the problems behind problems and potential issues. If things are going well,
                    the team and other stakeholders benefit from knowing and getting some positive praise and feedback.
                    This lifts morale and helps to keep people motivated and focused.</p>
