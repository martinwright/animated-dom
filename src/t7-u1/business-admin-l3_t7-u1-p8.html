                <img src="../images/t7-u1/managing_resources_01.jpg"
                     alt=""
                     style="width:100%;"
                     data-animate="6"/>

                <p>Human resources need to be planned carefully too. Managers need to work out the range of skills,
                    knowledge and experience that they need on their team to be able to achieve the objectives. This is
                    the case for normal additional tasks, such as doing an extra production run at the end of a shift,
                    or for a large-scale project of new work, such as setting up a brand new store, factory or
                    office.</p>

                <p>The people that managers need to implement team and organisational plans could be, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>members of the existing workforce</strong><br>eg established employees on the manager’s
                        team; staff from other teams and departments
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>bank staff</strong><br>eg trained employees who just work from time to time
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>job agency staff</strong><br>eg temporary staff who are called in to cover periods of
                        high output, sickness or holidays
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>new recruits</strong><br>eg people taken on to cover specific roles that cannot be
                        filled by the existing workforce
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>consultants</strong><br>eg individuals or companies that are contracted to do certain
                        tasks for the organisation, in the long term or short term
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>volunteers</strong><br>eg recruited to do a full range of short-term or long-term tasks,
                        especially in community and third sector organisations.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>As we know, the team members will have a wide range of skills, knowledge and experience. When
                    planning human resources for tasks, managers need to evaluate these and take into account whether
                    staff:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>are available, fully trained and ready to be fully operational with no further input
                    </li>

                    <li>need a small amount of training and support for them to be fully effective
                    </li>

                    <li>need complete training and guidance from the manager or others
                    </li>

                    <li>come from a reliable source – eg an agency that they use regularly who know the operational requirements
                    </li>

                    <li>are versatile and flexible – eg able and willing to do a variety of different tasks.
                    </li>
                </ul>
