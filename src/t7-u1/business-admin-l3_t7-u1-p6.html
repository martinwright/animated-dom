                <div class="p-60">

                <p>It is important for managers to understand any budget that they have been allocated for implementing
                    plans. They need to work with those responsible for making financial decisions so that everyone
                    involved can, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>work out and agree the priorities – eg for a project, department or organisation
                    </li>

                    <li>agree responsibilities, accountability and limitations – eg budget limits and who to go to if there are problems
                    </li>

                    <li>make sure that a sufficient budget is agreed to cover all spending requirements, including contingencies
                    </li>

                    <li>understand budget limits – eg to prevent overspending.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Budgets are usually agreed and negotiated:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>at the beginning of the planning and preparation stage of objectives
                    </li>

                    <li>when a budget is signed off for each phase of a project
                    </li>

                    <li>whenever there are changes that require renegotiation.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>It is important to keep the channels of communication open so that people can discuss issues,
                    problems and changes before they get out of hand.</p>

                <p>Budgets are usually strictly controlled and the manager is accountable and responsible for agreeing,
                    controlling and managing budgets. They need to consider, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>timescales</strong><br>to show when money is due to come in and go out – eg when income
                        from a client should be received
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>priorities</strong><br>to target resources correctly to support the efficiency and
                        effectiveness of the organisation – eg prioritising workforce costs; assessing and arranging
                        payments for urgent, planned and essential purchases
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>financial resources</strong><br>to match funding with anticipated income and expenditure
                        – eg helping to arrange business loans to finance long-term projects; dealing with increases and
                        decreases in revenue and expenses
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>contingencies</strong><br>eg negotiating and setting aside budgets and resources for
                        unpredictable and unforeseen circumstances.
                    </li>
                </ul>
