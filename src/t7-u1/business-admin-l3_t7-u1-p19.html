                <h4 data-animate="2">2 Using resources efficiently </h4>

                <p data-animate=“*”>When looking to improve the use of resources in the workplace that are related to external customers,
                    managers need to consider, for example:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li><strong>reducing packaging</strong> &mdash; eg encouraging customers to buy loose vegetables and
                        fruit; using smaller boxes, aerosol cans or plastic bags; cutting out unnecessary packaging;
                        using refill packs of coffee rather than new jars every time
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>developing packaging that uses fewer resources</strong> &mdash; eg boxes that stay together
                        with folds rather than glue; reusable bags for customers
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>reducing consumables given out</strong> &mdash; eg giving out one serviette per customer
                        rather than letting them help themselves to a handful; smaller serviettes or tray liners; small
                        hygienic packets of butter rather than a dish of butter that might be wasted.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate=“*”>When keeping down operational costs of the team or department, managers may consider, for example:</p>

                <ul data-animate=“*”>
                    <li><strong>reusing materials</strong> &mdash; eg storage boxes and trays that can be used many times;
                        using china mugs rather than disposable cups
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>avoiding scrap or waste</strong> &mdash; eg managing portion control in a restaurant;
                        training and monitoring production staff in a factory to help cut down on rejects and wasted
                        materials; checking cutting patterns to make sure that they are as efficient as possible
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>reviewing, designing or adjusting procedures, products or services</strong> &mdash; to
                        maximise the use of resources
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>electronic communication</strong> &mdash; emails or texts rather than paper memos
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>telephone and videoconferencing</strong> &mdash; rather than travelling around the UK or
                        abroad for meetings
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>using technology effectively</strong> &mdash; eg using smart meters or sophisticated tills to
                        measure consumption and target production efficiently; stock tracking systems to support
                        just-in-time supply chain management; computer-based training for staff
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>working to improve staff retention</strong> &mdash; eg managing the team well to avoid
                        excessive recruitment and training costs that occur when there is a high turnover of staff
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>ensuring work practices support compliance</strong> &mdash; eg to help avoid unnecessary
                        investigations, legal proceedings, fines, penalties, compensation and loss of reputation.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate=“*”>Managers need to be aware of changes to technology, products and processes to see if there are
                    well-researched, better alternatives.</p>
