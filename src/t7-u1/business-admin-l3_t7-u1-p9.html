                <p>When determining resources required in any organisation, estimations of costs should be made and
                    researched to ensure they are as accurate as possible. They may be based on recent past experience,
                    with an allowance for inflation and contingencies. A <strong>contingency</strong> is an allowance
                    that is built in to deal with any unforeseen rise in costs and is usually a percentage amount added
                    on to the budget.</p>

                <p><strong>Past usage</strong> – eg a stock control system will provide records of who is using specific
                    consumable items and to what level, as well as providing information about current stock levels. The
                    system should record both incoming and outgoing stock movements. Similarly, with accommodation, a
                    record of usage should be maintained, for example, through a bookings log for meetings rooms.</p>

                <p><strong>Colleagues</strong> – apart from consulting records, it will be necessary to ask colleagues
                    to identify their planned activities and corresponding resource needs. Prioritise the team’s
                    objectives and plan work to make the most effective use of time and resources, accurately
                    calculating risks and making provision so that unexpected events do not impede their achievement.
                    Discussions should be held with colleagues on resource usage and to help analyse the impact of past
                    decisions on physical resources. Areas of under resourcing will need to be managed.</p>
