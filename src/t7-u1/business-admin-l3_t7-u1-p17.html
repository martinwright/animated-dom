                <h2 data-animate="2">Achieving value for money when working with suppliers</h2>

                <p>According to the Oxford dictionary, the phrase <strong>value for money</strong> is ‘used in reference
                    to something that is well worth the money spent on it’. The concept of value for money encourages
                    organisations to make the best use of their resources to achieve objectives.</p>

                <p>Organisations work to <strong>receive value for money</strong> when they manage, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>operations</strong><br>eg refining policies and procedures to be as efficient as
                        possible
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>suppliers</strong><br>eg services provided by specialist contractors and consultants;
                        suppliers of raw materials and other goods
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>human resources</strong><br>eg employees, HR departments and management costs
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>physical resources</strong><br>eg equipment and machinery; factories, offices and retail
                        outlets
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>finance</strong><br>eg finding the best business loans for a business venture
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>waste</strong><br>eg energy, time, human and physical resources.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Achieving value for money helps an organisation to operate efficiently and effectively, which is an
                    important element when delivering profits to shareholders and securing jobs for employees.</p>

                <p>Many organisations also have a statutory responsibility to achieve value for money – eg when using
                    public funds.</p>

                </section>

            <section>

                <p>In smaller organisations, managers and directors will make the decisions about how to obtain value
                    for money when managing human and physical resources. Larger organisations can have procurement
                    specialists and departments – eg in national supermarket chains or the Ministry of Defence.</p>

                <p>Whatever the size of the organisation, the principles are the same. Physical resources need to
                    be:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>fit for purpose</strong><br>of sufficient quality for the intended use
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>sustainable</strong><br>from sources that can maintain the supply chain for future
                        purchases
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>ethically and legally sourced</strong><br>eg to comply with the organisation’s own
                        ethical policies
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>able to be reused, recycled or reconditioned</strong><br>where possible at the end of
                        their useful working lives.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>These factors are important when assessing value for money as money is not the only
                    consideration.</p>

                <p>Even if something is incredibly cheap, if it is not fit for purpose, it will not provide value for
                    money.</p>

                <p>In parallel to these factors, organisations will also negotiate with suppliers to get deals – eg the
                    best prices and discounts; favourable delivery and installation options; inexpensive and effective
                    warranties and aftercare service; other added-value features that may be available.</p>

                <p>Teams and departments can also make the most of the organisation’s resources and energy use to
                    maximise value for money. There can be a mixture of obvious and hidden costs that need to be
                    monitored as they all form part of the running costs that have to be met by the organisation.</p>

                <p>Teams or departments can deliver value for money for the organisation by:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>reviewing costs and operational activities regularly
                    </li>

                    <li>using resources efficiently
                    </li>

                    <li>using energy efficiently.</li>
                </ul>
