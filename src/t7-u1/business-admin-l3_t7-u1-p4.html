                <h4 data-animate="2">1 The organisation’s overall objectives and targets</h4>

                <img src="../images/t7-u1/organisational_culture_01_b.jpg"
                     alt=""
                     style="width:100%;"
                     data-animate="6"/>

                <p>The organisational targets are the overall aims for the whole organisation. When implementing plans,
                    the objectives and activities of each division, department, office, team and individual need to be
                    aligned to support these overall aims.</p>

                <p>Organisational targets could include, for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>increasing sales by 20% over two years
                    </li>

                    <li>reducing landfill waste by 40% over five years
                    </li>

                    <li>being the number one retailer in the specialist area – eg clothing, food or holidays
                    </li>

                    <li>having excellent customer feedback with at least 95% positive feedback from satisfaction surveys
                    </li>

                    <li>introducing new technology and having it tested and fully up and running within three months
                    </li>

                    <li>expanding the business into another country
                    </li>

                    <li>restructuring the business to make it more efficient and profitable
                    </li>

                    <li>working towards bidding for a large government contract
                    </li>

                    <li>to recruit and retain the best staff in the industry.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Each team will have a different input into the organisation to help it achieve its overall targets.
                    For example: the sales and marketing team would be very involved with increasing sales, expanding
                    into new markets and bidding for new contracts; the production team might be more closely involved
                    with reducing waste and introducing new technology; the HR department would be closely involved with
                    staff recruitment and retention.</p>
