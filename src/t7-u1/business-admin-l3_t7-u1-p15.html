                     alt=""

                     data-animate="6"/>

                <p>If you are responsible for procuring resources, you will need a system in place to
                    <strong>monitor</strong> and record the quality of resources. You need to monitor the quality of
                    resources continuously and make sure <strong>standards of service</strong> and <strong>product
                        delivery</strong> are maintained. Problems such as damaged or faulty goods, failure to match
                    agreed specification and non-delivery all need to be resolved with the minimum
                    disruption to work.</p>

                <p>Although you can never completely eradicate such problems, one way to minimise the possibility of
                    them occurring is to <strong>select your suppliers carefully</strong>. Sometimes organisations have authorised
                    suppliers but, if you need to choose a new supplier, you should evaluate their worth not only on the
                    price offered, but also on their reliability and competence. Carry out <strong>desk research</strong> on the supplier
                    to establish the ‘health’ of the company, for example examining their balance sheets, checking
                    whether they hold any recognised BS/ISO competence standards, their record of strike actions. You
                    should also carry out field research to evaluate past performance. </p>

                <p>When selecting products/suppliers, you should take into consideration:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>suitability for purpose
                    </li>

                    <li>price
                    </li>

                    <li>discounts available
                    </li>

                    <li>terms of payment
                    </li>

                    <li>delivery charges that may apply
                    </li>

                    <li>after-sales service and any associated charges
                    </li>

                    <li>reliability/reputation of the supplier
                    </li>

                    <li>guarantees/warranty.
                    </li>
                </ul>
