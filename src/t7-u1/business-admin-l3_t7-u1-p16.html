                <p>Organisations have set procedures for ordering goods and services. Depending on the size and type of
                    the organisation, the finance or buying department may raise an official purchase order on
                    instruction.</p>

                <p>You may be required to obtain a number of quotations or write a specification for a product or
                    service in order that suitable suppliers can tender. The specification provides a description of
                    exactly what the supplier is expected to quote for. As well as the requirements of the product or
                    service, the specification will outline other standards that the supplier will need to meet, for
                    example, aspects relating to timeliness of supply, specific health and safety standards, diversity
                    or environmental issues.</p>

                <p>Existing or permanent specifications for supply of services should be reviewed regularly to ensure
                    that they remain relevant and cost-effective in relation to quality and standard.</p>

                <p>Normally, once the supplier is selected, the purchase will have to be authorised by someone senior
                    enough to do so. This many involve producing a purchase requisition or simply having the purchase
                    order authorised.</p>
