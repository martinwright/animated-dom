                <p data-animate="4">The skills audit will help to analyse the current position ‚Äì where I am now ‚Äì and reveal areas that are strong and those that need attention. These can be entered on the PDP, so that you can see your strengths and skills gaps, then start to decide what you need or want to consolidate or improve.</p>

                <p data-animate="5">Having analysed where you are now, you can work out where you want to be, then set personal objectives to plan how to improve your performance at work. When setting personal work objectives, it is important to have a realistic number of goals. If overloaded, you will feel overwhelmed and are more likely to fail, give up and lose confidence. Honesty about achievements and expectations is important.</p>

                <p data-animate="6">It can be useful to support this process with personal reflection and discussions with senior colleagues, maybe during the appraisal process. Once you have established your needs, you can set objectives that support your strengths, address your weaknesses and help you improve your performance.</p>
