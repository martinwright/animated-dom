                <p data-animate="4">Once objectives have been set and agreed, it helps to be aware of different learning styles so that you can focus on the most suitable learning activities.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">We all have our preferred learning styles that we use to develop our skills, experience and knowledge. Some people like to learn by reading about things, others need to see a demonstration to understand something and others need to try the activity themselves before they remember everything.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">There are many theories about learning styles. Here are some brief details about one of the most commonly used theories – <strong>VARK
                    – Visual, Auditory, Reading/writing, Kinaesthetic</strong>.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">People have favourite ways of learning and training needs to be adapted to accommodate these preferences where possible. These four styles are:</p>

                <ul data-animate="5">
                    <li><strong>visual</strong><br>seeing and reading – eg watching a training video, reading instructions</li>
                    <li><strong>reading/writing</strong><br>eg reading instructions and writing personal notes</li>
                    <li><strong>auditory</strong><br>listening and speaking – eg being told how to give a training presentation</li>
                    <li><strong>kinaesthetic</strong><br>touching and doing – eg physically preparing and delivering a training presentation under supervision.</li>
                </ul>

                <p data-animate="4">According to this model, people have a dominant or preferred learning style.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">A visual learner will learn about a subject by looking at graphs, pictures and diagrams, or watching videos or demonstrations. Just being told about what to do will not register. Touching and doing the new activity will help to reinforce the learning at a basic level, but they will need to observe and read up on the details.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">A reading/writing learner will learn best from reading instructions, research and information about the subject, and writing notes to help them remember important details.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">An auditory learner will absorb the information by listening to their tutor or colleague, asking questions, then listening carefully to the answers.</p>

                <p data-animate="4">A kinaesthetic learner needs to touch and do the activity. They may absorb a reasonable amount of information from listening to the tutor or watching a demonstration, but they will not truly understand the subject or activity until they do it for themselves.</p>
